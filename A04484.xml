            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

You may not ſay, it ſhall be greate diſhonour to the realme, to haue ſuch ſcripturs knowne, for want of diſcrecion in you, to vtter them: as you ſéeme to ſay in your let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Let vs know ſuche ſcriptures, as your truſt is moſt vppon, to proue your doctrine by, and we wil depart quietly. And as all wiſe men will counte it the office of a diſcrete man, either to ſtay ſuch as ſtagger, or to perſwade ſuche as verily thinke otherwiſe: So ſhall I not onely ſo thinke, but alſo if you giue me good cauſe why, yelde you greate thankes, and my poore ſeruice to.

But you haue none, as your ſilence importeth. It were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great folly to kéepe that ſecret, the whiche without any damage may doo good to many, or meruelous enuie to encloſe that without gaine, which law and reaſon woulde haue to be commen. <hi>Quicquid dando non deficit</hi> (ſaieth ſayncte Auſtin) <hi>Quamdiu habetur, &amp; non datur: non dum habetur, quomodo habendum eſt.</hi> All that decay not by beſtowynge, as long as they are had, and not beſtowed they are not yet had, as they ought to be had. The lawes may in diuers ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall factes, not reſtrained to time and place, teach perhappes, that a negatiue can not be proued. But to ſay that a
<pb facs="tcp:4121:5"/>negatiue in doctrine, as yours is, can not be proued vpon only conſideracion that it is a negatiue, as your ſhifte is, that I am well aſſured no learned man hitherto euer taught: either in law; or in any other ſcience beſides. Ye the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie rather appereth in Logicke: the whiche teacheth the generall groundes of all diſputacions. Where wée haue in euerie figure, negatiue concluſions. And for other ſhort kinde of argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, there are as many places dialecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal of the negatiues to deſtroy, as there are affirmatiues to builde on. So that ſhifte of deſcant can not ſerue your turne. Doeth not the ſcripture many times ioygne iſſue in the negatiue, and proue the ſame? Wée are not iuſtified by Moſes law, and ſo the like. Doeth not the Apoſtels proue it at large? But for as much as you are not able to proue the negatiue, I will no further trouble you therwith. Yet when there is an affirmatiue imploied in the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:4121:5"/>as there is here, thoughe I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge you of very gentilnes from the proufe of thone, order of ſchooles will driue you to proue the other: though it were in factes, muche more in doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Your negatiue was,<note place="margin">2. Cap.</note> that there was no priuate Maſſe at all, in the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue churche: thus you ſay, and ſhewe no cauſe why. This terme priuate,<note place="margin">A diſtictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of priuate</note> whiche you in this place firſt inuented, I meane Luthers ſchoole, may be taken concerning this matter diuers waies. One way, priuate is contrarie to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,<note place="margin">A.</note> to many. And in this ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, wée neuer ſaied that any Maſſe was priuate. For the catholike church euer taught, that the Maſſe is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or publique ſacrifice, reſtrained to none ſo, but that the whole churche, or any liuely membre therof, had thereby great commoditée: and might, beyng prepared, and well diſpoſed, bee parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, not onely of the common Praier and Suffrages offered vp to God in the
<pb facs="tcp:4121:6"/>Maſſe, but alſo of the holy ſacramente of Chriſtes body and bloud therin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated, and offered. Wée neuer yet priſoned vp the holy Sacrifice of the Maſſe, or the ſacramente therin recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or the vſe of ani of them, from any that diſpoſed them ſelues godly. If you had harde vs preache that the Maſſe is onely auailable to the prieſt, or to prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or to vs of England, or to them of Italie, or to men, and not to women, or to ſuch as are aliue, and not to ſuche as are dead, or to ſay that none ought to receiue the Sacrament, but the prieſt, you might haue charged vs that wée wente aboute to encloſe that to ſome one ſorte of priuate profit, that ought to remaine in common for all ſortes of people. And in this wiſe wée neuer taught, that any Maſſe was priuate. But you haue the other ſignificacion of this terme priuate.<note place="margin">B.</note> That is, the ſoole receiuynge of the Sacramente by the prieſt, imbarrynge none to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:4121:6"/>with him, yea rather reioyſing, if any would be ſo wel diſpoſed to receiue with him. And lamentynge, when he ſéeth the people ſo euill diſpoſed, that none will order theim ſelues ſo, that they may worthely receiue with him. And yet not forſying theim to receiue, when they are not diſpoſed, nor readie. And in this meanyng of priuate, the catholike churche doeth teache, that the prieſt may receiue the Sacramente at Maſſe alone, when none other is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to receiue with him. Now if you be able, wee require you to proue thaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatiue included in your negatiue. Whiche is this. That euery prieſt or any other ought, when he receiueth the ſacrament, to haue companie to receiue with him in the ſame time and place, vpon payne of Gods high indignation: and then wee will yelde vnto you. If you be able to proue neither the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, nor the affirmatiue, ſtorme not ſo ſore againſt the doctrine of the catholik

                  <p>As you ſay,<note place="margin">3.

                  <p>IT is wel knowen to a greate number, partly by preſence in hearinge, partely by wrytinge ſet forth of the ſame, that a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy learned man and Biſhop of this Realme, ſtoutly in dede, as the matter required, and clerkly alſo, as learning and knowlage taught him, did openly proteſt in certaine Sarmons not to the furtheraunce of vntrueth, as malice carpeth, but to the confuſion of falſhodde; as the ende proueth: that, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe things, which he then rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, could be proued of the contrary ſide by any ſufficient authoritie of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, olde doctours and auntient coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, or by any alowed example of the primatiue church, then he would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to ſubſcribe, and yelde to their doctrine. This his doynge, as no leſſe was to be loked for, ſum men depraued, many diſpraiſed, all they miſliked, that mainteined ſuche ſuperſtitious errours, as falſe teachinge hath trained people
<pb facs="tcp:4121:30"/>in, the ſpace of certaine hundred yeares. And in dede, ſeinge they harde their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine ſo plainely defaced, and their wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full miſleadynge of Chriſtian men ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly to be noted: a man maye thinke they had good cauſe to ſtartle at the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſomewhat to loke aboute them, leſte they ſeemed altogether careleſſe. Wherfore, as dyuers haue dyuerſly ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed theyr miſlikinge, ſo one of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hath in writing priuely ſpred abrode an anſwere to the forſaide offer or prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for priuate maſſes: wherin he both perſwadeth him ſelfe, and would haue other alſo to beleue, that he hathe ſo fully ſatiſfied the parties requeſt, as it maye ſeeme greate folly, and as he termeth it, impudencie, any longer to ſtaye vpon it. One of the copies of this anſwere by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion as it fortuned, not many mone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes ſence lighted into my hands: which, I vnderſtande, is ſo ſpred abrode in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places of this Realme, as there be fewe miſlikers of the trueth, but they haue it, and make ſuch accompte of it, as a greate number of the vnlearned ſorte ſtaie their conſciences there vpon. Who the aucthour is, or what maner of man, I neither knowe, nor can geſſe more,
<pb facs="tcp:4121:30"/>then he witneſſeth of him ſelfe in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traunce of this treatiſe. Where he ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, that once he imbraced that religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he now deteſteth and writeth againſt. In that parte me thinketh he doth deale, as fonde men ſometime are wonte to doe: which to diſpleaſe their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, ſticke not to hurte them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues alſo. So he, to diſcredite the doctrine that he is reuolted from, geueth ſuch te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of his owne naughtie life and conſcience, as he would be lothe to heare at any mans mouth but his owne. All that time (ſaieth he) &amp; neither regarded god, nor good relygion, nor any good conſcience beſide. What malice it is to charge the doctrine, that by hipocriſie he profeſſed, with the cauſe of his euill doinge, I will not declare with ſuche wordes, as the matter requireth. This muche I will ſaye, that he learned this of olde Adams greate councellour: Who at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge, beinge blamed for his diſobedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſeemed to bourden God him ſelfe with the cauſe of it: and excuſed his owne folly by that thinge, whiche his maker had geuen him to his comforte and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie. In like manner, when this mans conſcience, as it ſeemeth by hys
<pb facs="tcp:4121:31"/>owne wordes, accuſed him of lewde li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge and lacke of the feare of god, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe his owne ill diſpoſed minde, he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth the faute vpon the doctrine of the goſpell, whiche God did open vnto him vndoubtedly to his great commoditie, if he would haue taken it. And vnder this pretence, bothe forſaketh it him ſelfe, and by his example exhorteth other to eſchew it. But as the wicked life of a man, to his owne greate harme, may be a blotte to the religion, that he profeſſeth: ſo God forbidde it ſhould be compted a full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profe of the ſame, or a iuſte cauſe to be of all other reiected. If it were ſo, men ſhould refuſe Chriſtianitie, becauſe dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, not of the baſeſt ſorte, but of the heades of the Churche, as their owne hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories witnes, haue ben of horrible and wycked life. But we muſte thinke, that the hipocriſie and traiterous couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Iudas and his felowes is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion to them ſelfe, but no iuſt reproche to Chriſte that they folow, or to his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine that they ſeeme to profeſſe. I will iudge and hope better of this wryter, to whom with all my harte I wiſhe much more good: truſtinge that god ſhall once agayne open his hearte to receiue the
<pb facs="tcp:4121:31"/>trueth, which I cannot but thinke God hathe taken from him in puniſhment of that naughtie conſcience, that hee wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth hath ben in him ſelfe. But, what ſoeuer he be, let him ſtande or fall to his lorde god, I will not take vppon mee to iudge him, neither would I haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this much of him, but that hee doeth odiouſly excuſe his owne euill mynde by the good doctrine of Chriſtes goſpel. My purpoſe is to confute his doctrine, I wil not meddle with his perſon. I intende to anſwere his cauelinge at other mens wordes and doinges: I minde not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credite or deface his eſtimation or hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie. And yet in this pointe I know ſome maye iudge me preſumptuous and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, that I ſeeme to take vppon me his quarell, who is farre better able to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere for him ſelfe then I am. But I would deſire thoſe, whiche ſo thinke, to conſider: Firſte, that this is a common quarell, touchinge not only him, that is named, but all other that either teacheth or beleueth as he doth. Secondly, that he againſt whom this writing is directed, either knoweth not that any ſuch thinge is ſpred, or if he doe know it, either thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it not worthy anſwere of it ſelfe, or
<pb facs="tcp:4121:32"/>els hath not at this preſent ſuch leaſure, as he may intend to anſwere it. Thirdly and chiefely, that by priuate conference with certaine perſons, I vnderſtande, perhappes more then either he or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth thinke, how much this treatiſe is eſtemed amonge many, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe happely mighte bee perſwaded to imbrace the goſpell. Therefore I haue bene moued the ſoner my ſelfe, in ſuche ſorte as I might, to ſhape an aunſwere vnto it. For, to all ſuche of the contrary opinion, as haue feare of God, and ſtaye vpon conſcience rather then ſelfe wil, I acknowlage my ſelf in chriſtian charitie to owe this muche of dutie, as that I ſhould, to my power, trauaile to lift this ſtumbling blocke out of theyr way, that it maye not be a let or ſtaie vnto them to come vnto Chriſte, at this daye by his worde callinge them. Wherfore gentle Reader, ſeing thou doeſt vnderſtand my meaning and the occaſion of my doinge, I will ceaſe any more to trouble thee, and will tourne the reſidew of my talke vnto the aucthour of this wryting: with whom I will make my entrie there, where he firſt beginneth to confute the reaſons, that were alleged, why ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compte
<pb facs="tcp:4121:32"/>ſhould not bee made to Docter Cole of that religion that now is taught. In this parte I wil be the ſhorter, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe thoſe thinges bee ſufficiently anſwered in the conference already publiſhed, althoughe this wryter ſeemeth to diſſemble it: partly, becauſe the queſtions haue more captiouſnes of words then profit of good mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

That this was his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, it may appere in thoſe wordes, where he ſaith he might not doo it with out farther licence. Wherfore in this parte of his anſwere, knowyng with whome he had to doo, he reſpected his doctrine, as it was a law confirmed by the prince and ſtates of the realme: and not as it might be a controuerſie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb facs="tcp:4121:35"/>before the law publiſſhed. More ouer in that he is orderly called to the ſtate of a biſſhop (ſay you what you wil to the contrarie,) he is in poſſeſſion of the trueth: And therefore it were not reaſon, that he ſhould be requeſted firſt to ſhew his euidence and take vpon him the perſon of the plaintife: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially towarde thoſe men that make exception to his poſſeſſion, and claime the right therof them ſelues.

S.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacion were they neuer ſo holy.

That is true, that was firſt ordeined, &amp; that is corrupted, that is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter done. And Cyprian in the ſame epiſtle before mencioned. Hereof (ſaith he) ariſe diuiſions in the church, becauſe wee ſeeke not to the head, nor haue recourſe to the fountain, nor kepe the commaundementes of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly maiſter. Therefore, ſeyng it is ſo good a rule in religion to reſorte to the firſt inſtitucion, wée alſo without any iuſt reproche may require to haue the ſacramentes reformed, accordynge to the ſcripture and the primatiue church.
<pb facs="tcp:4121:42"/>But you thinke perhappꝭ, although for ſhame ye may not ſay it, that their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours in calder age of the churche, were of more wiſedome and diſcretion, and know better what they had to doo, then the Apoſtles and olde fathers.

When was it indued with ſo plentifull graces of the holy ghoſt, as it was in time of the Apoſtles and firſt fathers? Did it not appere in their pure life, in their feruent zeale, in their miraculous workyng? And will you then to defende your ceremonies affirme that time to be the ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie
<pb facs="tcp:4121:43"/>in the churche? Doo you not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that immediatly after ye at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the primatiue church paſſing feruent charitée, with excéedyng holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life, &amp; contempte of the world?

Not becauſe in the firſte time they were ſtronge in godly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, abundante in liuely ſpirite and grace of God? and wée now féeble and fainte to all vertuous doinge, lackinge wiſedome, and as it were dotinge for age? For what other cauſe was yonge age of children called infancie, then for that it had not the vſe of the tonge, nor coulde not ſpeake? But the primatiue Church coulde ſpeake, and continually declare the good will of God and his great benefites to his people. S. Paule ſpake with a loude voice and a ſtronge ſpirite: Woe be to me, if I preache not the goſpell. The ſame was the voice of all
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4121:43"/>the olde fathers and godly men in the beginning. They were occupied in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge but either in teaching and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firminge trueth, or in reprouinge and defacinge falſhode and hereſée: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>600.</hi> yeres the prelates of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che wel nere cleane loſte their voyces.

Wherefore ye can not ſo aprely reſemble the primatiue churche to infancie, as ye may this latter time to dotinge olde age: wherin they that ſhould doo nothinge but preache the worde of God and teache the people, haue either cleane loſte the vſe of their ſpeache throughe infancie and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or els bable they wot not what, through dotage and folly: That ye may not thinke mée to ſpeake of ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make

Your faute therfore in furtheryng his indeuour cannot be excuſed: But is to be taken of Chriſtian people as very gréeuous and heinous.<note place="margin">An obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> But ye wil ſay, that the prieſt doeth not imbarre any that will communicate: that he wolde reioyſe to ſe them diſpoſe them ſelues vnto it: that they doo lament to ſe the contrarie.<note place="margin">The aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere.</note> Theſe be faire wordes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſounde trueth at all. I aſſure you ſir, if the matter were ſo indéede vnfeinedly, &amp; not you by force of truth againſt you driuen to ſéeke that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretacion for a ſhifte, your ſoole recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng had ben muche more tollerable. But when I pray you did any of you vſe in priuate maſſes to cal for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? to reproue their ſlacknes? to ſhew them the daunger of beyng prieſente
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:4121:46"/>and not receiuyng? to tell them of the greate commoditées that commeth by the vſe of it? When did any of you ſtande at the aulter as Chriſoſtom did, and crie for the people to be partakers: declaryng to them, that, in being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at this heauenly feaſt as gaſers and no receiuers, they did runne into the indignation and diſpleaſure of god: euen as they, whiche, beyng bidde of a prince to a feaſt, and commynge into the houſe where tables be laied and furniſſhed with meate, will ſtande loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng on and eate none of it, muſte of neceſſitée greatly diſpleaſe that prince, whoſe prouiſion and furniture they doo ſo diſgrace. When (I ſay) did any of you folowe his example, whom vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly ye brynge for defence of your er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour? Is not the whole maner of your Maſſe contrarie to this? Doo you not turne from the people? Doo you not whiſper ſoftly to your ſelfe? Doo you not vſe a ſtrange language, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:4121:47"/>the people, neither the prieſtes ſometime doo vnderſtande? Do you not perſwade them, that they may haue the benefit of it, though they receiue not the ſacrament? Chriſoſtome proueth and other doctours witneſſeth, that thoſe, that be preſent and not receiue, doo wickedly and impudently: and you teache that, beyng preſente and not receiuynge, they doo holily and godly. If this be not to teache contrarie to the fathers and to the primatiue church I can not tell what may be contrarie. To conclude therfore, if the people be ſlacke and not wel diſpoſed to frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng of the ſacramente, the faute is in you. And you, whoſe duitie it was to warne and inſtructe them, ſhall make accompte for their decay and periſhing in their negligence. But the effecte of your argument, wherein ye alledge the colde charitée of the people, there by to driue vs neceſſarely to graunte ſole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuinge, tendeth to this ende: if their
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:4121:47"/>deuotion be ſo little, as they wyll not with callinge and exhortation diſpole theim ſelfe to receiue, wheather their wée will (as your phraſe is) pull the prieſte from the aulter. Firſte, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlage and amende that ſaute of your maſſe, wherin appereth neither callinge and exhortacion, nor geſture and language ſitte for that purpoſe. Then, I ſay it weare better not only to plucke him from the aulter, but alſo to caſte him out of the Churche to, rather then hee ſhould vnder that pretence both him ſelfe continually alter the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Chriſte, and alſo cauſe the people being preſent, by Chriſoſtomes witnes, to renne into gods diſpleaſure. Moreouer this keycolde charitée, that ye ſay the peoples heartes be froſen with, doth it ſtretche vnto prieſtes or no? Is their deuotion any hotter? ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their bourninge zeale, that of late time they haue vſed, proueth, and their hole behauiour to the worlde witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,

How happeneth then, that they doo ſo offen frequent the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in theſe daies? There were neuer halfe ſo many Maſſes (though ye take Maſſe for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion) as there is in this time.

But I anſwer that you, whiche ſay wee haue no colour of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for that wee herein defende, haue leſſe then a light ſhadow to hide your falſe aſſercion in: and that in this ye ſpeake cleane beſide the worde of god. Chriſtes inſtitucion was generall, and his commaundement therin ſtretcheth as well to the people as to the prieſtes. <hi>Take, cafe, drinke you all of this, doo this in remembrance of me,</hi> bindeth the people as wel as the prieſtes. That ye may not replie, that all whiche were preſente were prieſtes, becauſe they weare apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and ſo applie the ſacrament vnto prieſtes of neceſſitee, and to the people vpon free pleaſure: Vnderſtande you that S. Paule, a good interpretour of Chriſtes minde, applieth the ſame to the whole congregacion of Corinth: where, it is certaine, were both mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and common people. As for the
<pb facs="tcp:4121:49"/>duitie of miniſtracion, whereby per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes ye thinke prieſtes more boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: Ye ſhoulde not attribute more to the prieſt miniſtrynge, then to Chriſte miniſtring. But Chriſt tooke the bread, gaue thankes, brake it, gaue it to them preſent, willed them therin to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his death. Then the prieſt in his miniſtracion muſte doo as Chriſte did, and no otherwiſe: that is to take, geue thankes, breake &amp; geue vnto the people. But why ſhould he breake it, or howe ſhould he diſtribute it, if there be none preſente to receiue it. So that hereon I conclude the prieſt is not bounde to miniſter, if there be none to receiue.</p>
                  <p>If wee had no ſcripture at all to proue that the prieſt ſhould not receiue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out company: If ye did geue vs the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow in that: yet coulde ye not tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphe therin, as though ye had wonne the filde.

Our contention is for priuate maſſe, and your purpoſe is to proue your vſe of priuate maſſe to be good: of which ſole receiuinge is but one parte: and yet haue not ſufficiently concluded that neither. For it folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth not to ſay, the prieſte in caſe of neceſſitie, when none wil receiue, may take the Sacrament alone: Therefore he may doo it without neceſſitie, when hee may haue other to communicate with him.

Surely, weare my mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration muche more then yours is, I coulde not chuſe but terme this, not an itchinge foly, but an impudent wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ſo plainely to goo againſte the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe and apointed forme of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente.<note place="margin">F.</note> Becauſe ye vrge ſo earneſtly to haue dew profe againſte ſole recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge by the prieſte, if the people will not communicate: I will ſhewe you ſome reaſons.

The auncient hiſtories make menciou of diuers martirs, that died before they weare baptiſed, beinge excluded by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitee. And yet is this ſentence neues the leſſe true: Baptiſme is neceſſarie to a chriſtian man. Likewiſe if wes ſhould graunte your caſe of neceſſitee, yet is this ſentence alway true: The ſupper of the Lorde in the ordinary vſe of it ought of neceſſitie to haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants to be partakers of it.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4121:51"/>his Sacrament. I thought if (ſaith hee) both godſy and neceſſary to write, if any man continew in this errour (he meaneth vſing water only in the Sacrament in ſtede of wine) that he, ſeing the fighte, doe veturne to the roote and beginninge of the lordes ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and inſtitution. And thinke not that I doe this vpon my owne phantaſie or any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne iudgement. &amp;c. but when one is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the inſpiration and commanndmente of god, it is neceſſary for a faithful ſeruant to obey: beyng hofden excuſed with all men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he taketh nothinge vpon hym arrogant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that is compeſſed to feare the diſpleaſure of god, if he doe not as he is bidde. Doe you know therefore that we be admoniſhed, that in offeringe the ſacrament of the lorde bloud his owne inſtitution ſhould be kepte and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinge bee done, then that the lorde dyd firſt for vs him ſelfe? No man can make any exception to this propoſition, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he wyll cleane weaken Cyprians reaſon againſte thoſe abuſers of the Sacrament. And then ſhal we haue no ground to ſtay vpon, but euery gloſe or interpretation vpon humayne preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſhalbe admitted. This aſſertion of
<pb facs="tcp:4121:52"/>Cyprian is confirmed by Ambroſe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the firſt to the Corinthes. There hee ſaith, that they receiue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnworthely whiche celebrate o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then the Lorde deliuered it. For he (ſaith Ambroſe) cannot bee deuouie, which preſumeth to doe it otherwiſe then the aucth our hathe taughte. Yea and addeth that we ſhall make an accompte howe we haue vſed it. For the proofe of the Minor, let vs conſider the hiſtorie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as it is ſet out in the Euangeliſtes. In the celebration of the Sacramente vſed by Chriſte there appereth two partes: the mattier and the forme: The mattier is bread &amp; the body of Chriſte; wine and the bloud of Chriſt, of which, hee that altereth or taketh away any, doth alter and maime chriſtes inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as appereth by Ciprian. The forme of miniſtringe the Sacramente muſt be taken out of Chriſtes doinges. At that time it was taken, bleſſed with thankes geuinge, broken, diſtributed,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:4121:52"/>eaten, dronken, charge geuen to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member Chriſte and his death. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee that altereth or taketh away any of theſe things maimeth the forme of chriſtes inſtitution, and breaketh Ciprians rule. Moreouer the force of theſe wordes, Gaue to them preſent, doth binde to a company: becauſe it ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a beſtowinge of the death of chriſte not to one but to many. Therefore in Luke he geueth an expreſſe commaund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente of diſtributinge, as hee doeth of eating, and drinking: ſaying, Take you this and deuide it amonge you. But howe can he deuyde it, it there bee not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to receiue it: onleſſe we ſhould, to the deludinge of Chriſtes ordeinance, make ſuche a phantaſticall breakynge and deuiding, as you doo in your maſſe. For therin by <hi>Sergius</hi> decrée ye breake it into thrée partes: thone of which ye let fall into the wine, which there ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſigniſieth the body of Chriſt rayſed from death, and ſittinge in the glory:
<pb facs="tcp:4121:53"/>The other drie parte, that the pryeſte eateth, ſignifieth the body of Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge vpon the earth. The thirde parte, which is wonte to tary on the aulter to the ende of maſſe, ſignifieth the deade in the Sepulchers vntill the daye of iudgement. O great vanities where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God puniſheth the raſhnes of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhe men folowynge their owne phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies, and leauing his holy word. But to returne to the proofe of the mattier. I wyll folow Cipryans example, and confirme the maner of Chriſtes inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution by the teſtimony of. S. Paul. In him I finde two argumentes. One is in theſe wordes, <hi>Vnus panis vnum corpus muſti ſumus. Nam omnes de eodem pant participamus.</hi> Which wordes the holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers interpreting, cal the Lordes holy ſupper a Sacramente of vnitée. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that as the breade conſiſteth of many graines, and the wine made of many grapes, ſo wée, that bee parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of that one loffe and one cuppe,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:4121:53"/>ſhould be knit together in loue and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritée, as the members and partes of one miſtical body. Wherfore Chriſoſtome noteth that it is not ſayde, this eateth of one breade, and hee of another: but all be partakers of one breade: and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth why we be one loffe and one body. Becauſe of the common participacion that we haue of the ſacrament. This ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion is cleane taken away by priuate maſſe: the vſe wherof may ſéeme rather to be a Sacrament of ſeparation and diſpenſion, as after ſhall more appere. The ſeconde argumente out of Sainct Paul is, where to the Corinthꝭ he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth the abuſe of the lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per brought in by diſſenſion and facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that weare amonge them. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it came to paſſe, that one company would not tary for another to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, but one ſort would receiue with out another. Againſt this abuſe hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeth the inſtitution of Chriſt ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enge the ſame to be againſt ſuch recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge
<pb facs="tcp:4121:54"/>in partes, and therfore exhorteth them to tary vntill the congregation came together, that they might receiue according to Chriſtꝭ inſtitution. That this was. S. Paules minde, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by his firſt propoſition and reaſon, and by the concluſion that he addeth in the ende. When ye come together (ſaieth he) ye can not eate the Lorde ſupper, wher firſte it is to be noted that to the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracion of the ſacrament they reſorted together, and were not priuately in ſundry corners. He addeth the reaſon why they coulde not at their méetinges celebrate the Lordes ſupper. Becauſe euery man is occupied in eatynge his owne ſupper. Herein Paule blameth them, not onely for immoderate féedynge of their owne meate, but alſo for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered vſyng of the Lordes ſupper in partes: where as they ſhould be toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as Chriſt and his Apoſtles were. This he declareth more plainly in that concluſion, that he inferreth vpon the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:4121:54"/>reherſall of chriſtes wordes in ordering the ſacrament. For he ſaieth. Therfore my bretherne, when ye come together to eate the Lordes ſupper, do you tarie one for an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. What can more plainely declare that S. Paule tooke the right vſe of the ſacrament to be a common receiuynge together, and not a ſeuerall vſe by one man alone. As if he had ſaid: In chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes ſupper ye ſe the maiſter together with the diſciples, the table and the meate common to all, not ſo muche as Iudas the traitour excluded, one lofe and one cuppe diſcributed amonge the whole companie. Therfore when yee come together ye muſt imitate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde and equalitie, that he then vſed. If he thought it an abuſe in the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes to receiue in partes, he woulde counte it a farre greater abuſe for .x. or xii. to receiue eache of them ſeuerally in one church, at one time, as though they were of diuers religions, or membres of diuers miſticall bodies. If the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes
<pb facs="tcp:4121:55"/>in receiuyng by partes were bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of Paule, for that they ſéemed one to contemne an other: may not priſtes be as iuſtly blamed, becauſe they ſéeme in their priuate Maſſe to diſdeine and contempne the people? I wil now ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conclude with Cyprians wordes. If ſo be both it be ordeined by chriſte, and the ſame confirmed by the Apoſtle, that wee ſhould do in this ſacrament as our Lord did: wee finde that wee ſteepe not that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, if we do otherwiſe then Chriſt did. Séeyng then Chriſte vſed company in ordeinyng the ſacramente of that holy feaſt and ſupper: Prieſtes alſo ought to haue company in miniſtring the ſame. For the aucthoritée of the primatiue churche to confirme that this is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right vſe of the ſacramente,<note place="margin">Proufes againſte priuate maſſe, out of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> I will in this place bringe in onely twoo witneſſes: which ſhall not ſpeake of this mattier lightly or by the way: but of very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe declare the maner that then was vſed amonge the people of God, alowed and confirmed by godly and holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:4121:55"/>In ſo much that if any other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner had ben then vſed, they coulde not haue omitted the ſame: eſpecially ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng they profeſſed to declare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> maner of chriſtians therin. Iuſtine the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir in his Apologie deſcriueth it thus.</p>
                  <p>After prayer wee ſafute eache other with a kiffe: then breade and the cuppe mixed with water is brought to the chief brother, which after he hath taken geuing praiſe and than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes vnto the father of all in the name of the ſunne and holy ghoſt, for a ſpace he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in thankes geuynge. After praiers and thankes geuyng, the whole company ſaieth <hi>Amen.</hi> When the miniſters geuynge of thankes, and the peoples well wiſſhynge is finiſſhed: thoſe whiche wee call deacons gene parie of the breade and cuppe, ouer whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che thankes is geuen, vnto euery one that is preſent, yea and ſuffer the ſame to be caried to them that be abſent. This nouriſhment we call Euchariſtiam, the ſacrament of thankes geuing. A litle after he declareth the ſame thyng agayne. On ſunday (ſaith he) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of the towne and countrey come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Where leſſons of the prophetes and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles be redde. When the clarke ceaſeth, the miniſter exhorteth and allureth them to
<pb facs="tcp:4121:56"/>the imitation of ſo holy thinges. Afier, we all ariſe and pray. Then (as I ſaid) bread and wyne mixed with water is brought foorth, and the chiefe miniſter ſo muche ae he can praieth, and geueth thankes, the people ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyng Amen. Then the thynges conſecrated are diſtributed to al preſent, and be ſent by the Deacons to thoſe that be abſent. The ſame forme and maner of celebracion of the ſacrament with very little difference is witneſſed by <hi>Dioniſius:</hi> who in <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtica Hierarchia</hi> after he hath deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a few other circumſtances, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that only they taried in the churche whiche weare méete for the ſighte and communion of the deuine and holy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament addeth this. After hee hathe ſhe, wen the gifts of thoſe diuine workes he hoth commeth to the communion of the ſame hym ſelfe, and alſo allureth other. When the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine communion is bothe taken and geuen, it endeth in holy thankes geuinge. Woulde a man deſire any plainer teſtimony of the vſe of the Lordes ſupper in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue Churche? Doth not all thynges agre with the inſtitution of chriſte and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:4121:56"/>example of the Apoſtle? Is here any coniecture either of the laitée receiuing vnder one kinde? or of ſole receiuynge by the prieſt? or of ſacrifienge the body and bloud of Chriſte for quicke &amp; dead? Is here any worde or ceremony that ſignifieth ſuche vſe to haue bene at that time? Yet (as I ſayd) theſe men write not of this mattier by the way, but of purpoſe vndertake to ſhew the maner of the churche in their daies. And wyll you yet continew to affirnie that wee haue no colour or title in the ſcripture and fathers for the reproffe of your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate maſſe. But ye wil vrge, after your maner, to haue an expreſſe ſentence, that forbiddeth the prieſt to receiue without company. I anſwere Chriſtes inſtitucion, the example of the apoſtels, the common vſe of the fathers was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wayes: therfore the prieſte ſhould not communicate without other. Ye haue no expreſſe commaundmente that forbiddeth you to baptiſme in the name
<pb facs="tcp:4121:57"/>of the father only, but that chriſtes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution was otherwiſe. Wyl ye ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſay that ye may withoute offence baptiſe in the name of the father only? If chriſtes inſtitution in baptiſme be a ſufficient forbidding of the contrary to be vſed: why ſhould not his wordes and mauer vſed in the ſupper forbidde you to doe the contrary? Ciprian (as I haue ſayde) taketh it for a full prohibition of the contrary: and if you wil not, ye muſt of neceſſitie weaken his reaſoninge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe that he writeth: which dyd bringe euen as good reaſons and as holy conſiderations for their parte, as ye be able to deuiſe any for yours. Now that I haue in this manner-layed the foundacion of our proofes, I wil procede to examine the reſidew of your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes againſte vs.</p>
                  <p>In recityng the aucthoritie of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome you brynge in a ſimilitude or compariſon,<note place="margin">4. Cap.</note> which of how ſmall force they be in prouyng, your learnyng can
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:4121:57"/>not be ſo little, but that ye muſt néedes know.<note place="margin">A.</note> Euen as (ſay you) it is to be wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed that al contencion and ſtrife were cleane baniſſhed, and yet men are not to be forbidden to ſue for their righte when they be iniured: ſo is it to be wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed that people were ſo deuoute, as they woulde dayly receiue their howſill (for ſo ye terme it.) And yet is not the prieſt to be letted to receiue, when the people wil not diſpoſe them ſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. Beſide that ye conclude here only the caſe of neceſſitie (whiche healpeth the common vſe of your priuate Maſſe very little.) Ye make your compariſon betweene thynges very vnlike and of nature diuers: that is, between poſſible and vnpoſſible, and lawful &amp; vnlawful. That all cotencion ſhould be baniſſhed from amonge men in this worlde is a thing vnpoſſible, &amp; a perfection not to be looked for in this fraile life. But in a chriſtian congregacion to haue ſome of the people or miniſters to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate
<pb facs="tcp:4121:58"/>orderly with the chiefe miniſter cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bratynge is a thynge ſo poſſible, as bothe the ſpace of many hundred yeres it was continually vſed in the churche, and may at this day with good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and inſtruction of the miniſters be brought to paſſe, although not euery day, yet very often times. Moreouer to ſue for ones right is not only a thing ſuffered, but of it ſelfe lawful and good: and wée haue therof example and auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritée in gods worde. But for the prieſt to miniſter the lordes ſupper a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, is a thyng neither tollerable nor lawfull, but contrarie to the forme that Chriſt him ſelf vſed, neither haue wée either aucthoritée or example in the ſcripture as a ſufficient warrant to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that forme that he vſed and apoinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Therfore your compariſon is fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie on bothe partes: and eſpecially for that ye ſéeme to gather therby, that it is no more neceſſarie for company to receiue with the prieſt, then it is to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:4121:58"/>haue all contencion baniſſhed from chriſtian men: whiche, as I haue ſayd, in the frailtée of this woride is vnpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. If ſuche ſimilitudes ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, a man might breake all gods commaundementes, and yet proue him ſelf not to do amiſſe. Is not this a ioyly reaſon thinke you? As it is to be wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed that all variance and ſtrife were cleane abandoned from amonge chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian men, and yet are not they to be forbidden to ſue for their right, which be iniured of other: ſo it is to be wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed that all vnmaried prieſtes did liue chaſte: but if they can not, the biſſhop muſt not forbid them to haue a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I will make your ſelfe iudge. All your drifte in this parte is, by alledgyng the corruption of the worlde and ſlackneſſe of deuocion, to ſignifie, that the people
<pb facs="tcp:4121:59"/>can not bee brought to communicate with the prieſt: and therfore of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie that he may receiue alone. But, be the world neuer ſo corrupte, I thinke it as vnpoſſible, to haue a prieſt to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate deuoutly euery day: as it is to haue ſome of the people often times to communicate with the prieſt. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I may as effectually conclude, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the corruption of this time, that prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes can not bee brought deuoutly to Maſſe euery day: as ye doo, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple can not diſpoſe them ſelfe, in this colde charitie, godly to frequent the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. And then were ye beſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine your dayly maſſynge prieſtes, and apoincte them, either to once, or at leaſt to fewer times in the yere: as ye haue taken order for the people gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to receiue only at Caſter.<note place="margin">B</note> But the prieſte (ſay you) is bounde to offer vp the dayly ſacrifice for himſelfe and for the people. This is the roote of all the abuſes of the Lordes ſupper, that ye
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:4121:59"/>haue brought into the churche of chriſt. This is it, wherwith ye doo pitifully deface the death and paſſion of Chriſt, makinge your ſelues, for your glories ſake, as it were means of reconciliaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwene god and his people. This is it, that hathe diſcouraged chriſtian people from the often vſe and frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion of the Sacramente. For hereby ye ſignifie, that, of neceſſitie, it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth only to the prieſt, and (as you wrote before) the people to be lefte free to come as ſeldome as they wyl. This ye take for the grounde of your reaſon in this place: and yet within few lines haue twiſe reherſed it withoute any proofe at all. But in déede ye muſte of neceſſitée leaue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vnproued: that ye be not in any wiſe able to proue. For, ſure I am, that neither the inſtitucion of Chriſt maketh mencion of any oblation or ſacrifice to be done by the miniſter, ſauinge only the ſacrifice of thankes geuing: for yet the ſcripture apointeth
<pb facs="tcp:4121:60"/>any bounden duty for the prieſt more to vſe the ſacrament then other godly and wel diſpoſed chriſtian men. What ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificacion haue you in the wordes that chriſt vſed in ordeining the ſacrament, or in the maner of his doynge, that hee then offered him ſelfe to his father? He did that the next day after him ſelf vpon the croſſe, as S. Paule ſaieth, perfectly once for euer: neither doeth he graunt his priuilege of the euerlaſting prieſthodde to any, but to him ſelfe. Therfore when your prieſtes take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them his office to offer ſacrifice propitiatorie: they goe beyonde theyr commiſſion, and take more vpon them then their dutie, not without iuſte re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of arrogancie and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Chriſtes inſtitution (as the euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſtes &amp; S.

Firſt, <hi>Cſemens, Aſexander, Teriuſſian, Jraenens</hi> and other make mencion of a certaine oblation or offering that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten people commonly vſed, when they came together to celebrate the Lordes Supper. In this they offered vp bread, wyne, and victuals abundantly, not only to ſerue the communion (as wee
<pb facs="tcp:4121:61"/>had a ſhadow of late yeres in the holy lofe): but alſo that of the ouerplus ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of aſwell the miniſters might haue their findinge, as poore people alſo be refreſhed. Hereof partely it came to paſſe, (the erample beinge taken firſte of the common people) that the admy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtracion of the Sacramente, of this offeringe, was called an oblation. As in <hi>Jraeneus ſib. <hi>4</hi> cap. <hi>32.</hi>
                     </hi> He taught vs a new oblacion of the new teſtamente: whiche, the church takinge of the apoſtels, offereth vp to god in all the worlde. But in other places after, as in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>34.</hi> cap. he expoundeth him ſelfe and ſignifieth that he ſpeaketh not of the offeringe of the Sacrament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated, but of the breade and wine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered: partely, to the vſe of the ſupper: partely, to the findinge of the poore. <hi>Vt behoneth vs</hi> (ſaith hee) to offer to god the firſt fruites of his creatures. And againe a lyttle after. We muſt make offeringe vp to god and in all thinges be found thankfull to god our maker, offeringe vp to him the firſte fruites of his creatures, in pure mynde, in

And this pure offeringe the church only offereth to our maker, geuinge to hym parte of his creatures with thankes geuyng. Inſtine alſo, in his Apology, affirmeth: that, after the communion, all that would offered to the behalfe of poore people, fatherleſſe children, and ſicke perſons. An other occaſion that the doctours vſed thoſe termes of ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enge and offeringe was, that in cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Sacramente, they had prayer for all ſtates, and thankes ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to god for all his benefites: which the doctours in infinite places affirme to be the true and only ſacrifice of the new teſtament. <hi>Cſemens Aſexan.

Sainct Auguſtine alſo <hi>de fide ad petrum,</hi> declareth the ſame very plainly. Belene ſtedfaſtly (ſaieth he) and in no wapee doubte, that the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of God, beyng made fleſh for vs, did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him ſelfe a ſactifice to God as a ſweete ſauour.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:4121:63"/>father and holy ghoſt, with whom he hath one diuinitie, the churche ceaſeth not to offer the ſacrifice of breade and wine. (He ſaieth not of the body and bloud of Chriſt.) For in thoſe carnall ſacrifices there was the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the fleſhe of Chriſt: which. &amp;c. but in this our ſacrifice, there is a thankes geuinge and remembrance of the body and blond of Chriſt, that hee gaue and ſhed for v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. Here he ſaith not, there is an offering of the body &amp; bloud for our ſinnes, whiche he would not haue omitted, if the churche had taught ſo in his time. For ſome of theſe cauſes before reherſed, the fathers vſed to cal the Lordꝭ ſupper a ſacrifice: not meanyng, as you doo, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was a ſacrifice propitiatorie to be offered of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prieſtes for them ſelfe &amp; for the people. This your facion of ſpeakyng ye ſéeme to take of the maner of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewiſſe prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes: which had an offeryng for them &amp; the people. As though Chriſt had left to vs a like ſacrifice, as they had, dayly to be repeted: where as S. Paule in his whole Epiſtle to the Ebrues reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb facs="tcp:4121:64"/>againſt it: and proueth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, that Chriſte did it perfitly once for euer, in ſuche ſorte, that it néedeth not to be reiterated. But perhappes ye will obiecte S. Cyprian, where he ſpeakynge of the dead ſaieth. We offer ſacrifice for them. But it is euident he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered there for Martiers: whiche, he was throughly perſwaded, were in heauen, and néeded no offerynge for their ſinnes. Likewiſe Ambroſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioneth, that he offered for Valentinia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the good Emperour: of whom (in the oracion made at his buriall) he witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that he doubted not of his ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, but beléeued, by the witneſſe of Angels, that he was caried to heauen. Therfore their offeryng for the deade was no more, but, as I mencioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the ſacrifice of prayſe and thankes geuynge to God for them. This thyng the Greeke Cannon declareth more plainely: where it is mencioned, that they offered for the Patriarkes, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:4121:64"/>Apoſtles, ye and for the bleſſed virgin Mary the mother of God. For whoſe ſinnes, it can not be, that they offered: whiche, by the teſtimony and faith of the whole church, be with God in heauen. This thynge is well deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criued by Chriſoſtom vpon the. <hi>8. <hi>cap.</hi>
                     </hi> of <hi>Math.</hi> Therfore (ſaith he) the prieſt ſtanding at the auſter, when the ſacrifice is propoſed, commaundeth vs to offer thankes to God for the whole world, for them that be abſet, for thoſe that were before vs, and for thoſe that ſhall come after vs. The ſame Chriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome alſo calleth this their offerynge, <hi>Rationalem cultum,</hi> whiche yee can not interprete a propitiatorie ſacrifice, but a reaſonable worſhippyng of God by praier and thankes geuyng for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſainctes: by the whiche he hath buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his churche, and whiche nowe remaine as membres and partes of his miſticall body: whervnto we alſo, by the celebration of the ſacrament, be ioygned, and ſo, as it were, kniffe in v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitée with them. This was their offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng
<pb facs="tcp:4121:65"/>for the dead, and not a practiſe to pull ſoules out of Purgatorie for mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe and money, as ye haue vſed in your priuate Maſſes a great numbre of yeres, to the great defaſing of the death and paſſion of Chriſte.

For the Lordes ſupper (as I ſayde before) is a gifte of God to vs: whiche wée muſte receiue with thankes geuyng. Your ſacrifice is a price to be paied to God, and of him to be taken as a ſatiſfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The Lordes ſupper is a remembrance of one perfit ſacrifice: wherby we were once ſufficiently purged from ſinne, and continually are reuiued by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame. Your ſacrifice is a dayly offeryng vp of Chriſte for our ſinnes: as thoughe it had not ben perfitely doone at the firſt. The Lordes ſupper is to be diſtributed

For, after they once beléeued, that prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes muſt ſacrifice for them: they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to leaue the communion, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentation of the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as a thing either not apperteinyng, or very little apperteining to them, but eſpecially to prieſtes. And, by that meanes, the way was made to your common vſe of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate Maſſe. So muche difference there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as is betwéene to géeue, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue: to remember one perfit ſacrifice, and dayly to reiterate a ſacrifice: to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate in common as a teſtimony of vnitie, to créepe in corners or by chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels as a ſigne of ſeperation: ſo muche difference is there betwéene the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

For euen in the ſame place,<note place="margin">D.</note> not many lines before the wordes that ye recite, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth that a number vſed to receiue at certaine other times.<note place="margin">C.</note> 
                     <hi>I ſe many</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>raſhly, not paſſyng how, and more of a cuſtome then lawfully and of good conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to be partakers of chriſtes body.</hi> Yf <hi>the holy time of lent were at hand</hi> (ſay they) <hi>if the day of Epiphanie were come: hauinge no regarde what he is, that is partaker of the miſteries. But the time of cumming to it, the Epiphanie, the holy ſeaſon of Lente doth not make them worthy that come: but the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie and putitie of minde.</hi> Doo ye not here perceiue, that many vſed ordinarely to come to the Communion at the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanie,
<pb facs="tcp:4121:67"/>and in lent, as well as he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioned before at Eaſter? howe can ye then gather by Chriſoſtome that there was no company to receiue but only at Eaſter? but what if I declare oute of Chriſoſtome, that ſome vſed to receiue oftener times? wyll not your collection vppon this place, that ye ſéeme to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphe vpon, appere to be of very ſmal force. <hi>Hom. 17. ad Hebreos.</hi> Many (ſaieth he) <hi>take of this ſacrifice once in the whole yere, ſome twiſe, ſome oftener times.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is moſte euident, that Chriſoſtom had other to communicate with him at diuers other times beſide Eaſter. The maner was (I graunte) that ſome of cuſtome addicted theim ſelues to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne dayes. And in ſome places the biſhops or ſinodes apointed men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, once, twiſe, thriſe or fower times in the yere (as Auguſtine witneſſeth). <hi>Concilium Eliberinum</hi> apoynteth to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate thriſe in the yere. But theſe preſcripte times were ordeined onely
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:4121:67"/>for them, that vſed ſeldome to come to the ſacrament, that at the leaſte, they ſhould receiue at thoſe times, if they would knowlage them ſelues to bée of the church. Notwithſtandinge they did not only leane frée to other to frequent the ſacrament, but earneſtly calleth them to it at euery aſſembly of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. As Ambroſe greuouſly blameth the cuſtome of many in the Eaſte partes, that vſed to come but once in the yere: and ſaith, that hée, whiche is not méete to receiue euery day, wyll not be méete to receiue once a yeare. Therfore as in the primatiue church very many in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places vſed to be partakers of the ſacrament, but ones, twiſe, or thriſe, in the yere: ſo it is euident, that dyuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther better diſpoſed dyd receiue with the byſhop and miniſters at ſundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times. That forte, becauſe they were not ſo many as they ſhould haue hene, and as Chriſoſtome wiſhed for to haue in his church, to exaggerate their
<pb facs="tcp:4121:68"/>ſlacknes, hee ſaieth, <hi>There is none to bée partaker with be.</hi> Meaninge that they were very fewe and ſeldome in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of that their duitie was. But if ye wyll ſtand vppon theſe few ſilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, <hi>Nemo eſt,</hi> to proue that ſomtime the miniſter receiued alone: I anſwer, all be it this place did proue, that none of the common people would commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, whoſe ſlacknes, he there repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth: yet ye cannot by this teſtimony declare, that none of the miniſters or the clergie receiued with hym heynge byſhop there. For the maner was not then, as you doo vſe it now, that euery prieſte receiued particularly at an aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by him ſelfe: but all the myniſters and clergy did communicate together with the byſhop or chiefe miniſter that celebrated. This to proue true, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I coulde bringe in many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and teſtimonies, yet I wil content my ſelfe with one, that your ſelfe put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth me in minde of, in recitinge after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:4121:68"/>the .14. cannon of Nicene coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell: for therein order is taken by that holy counſell, that the deacons ſhould not miniſter to the byſhop and prieſts, nor receiue before them, but after in order as it ſéemed more conuenient. Loke for further declaration of this, in examininge the cannon that ye after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde alledge. Wherefore this your place of Chriſoſtome doth not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently iuſtifie ſole receiuinge by one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, as ye would haue it ſeeme to do, for proufe of your priuate maſſe. But if I ſhould flatly deny, that the myni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter receiued, when none of the people were partakers, how coulde you proue it by this place? Ye wyl ſay, becauſe he calleth it, <hi>Quotidianam oblationem,</hi> and the people, as appeareth, did not euery day communicate. I anſwere, hee na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it <hi>Oblationem,</hi> either for that it was done in the remembraunce of Chriſtes ſacrifice, or for the offeringe vp of the breade and wine to the celebration of
<pb facs="tcp:4121:69"/>the Lordes ſupper: he called it <hi>Quotidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anam,</hi> to the inmitacion of the ſacrifice of the olde lawe: not becauſe it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day done withoute intermiſſion, but for that it was oftentimes celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: that is, ſo often as the people aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled together to the church or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon place of prayer: as hee him ſelfe witneſſeth vpon the. 8. chapiter of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew. At which times he alwaies had, either ſome of the people, or the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dew of the myniſters and clergie to communicate with him: as the maner of that time was. But ye wil here dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon the proper ſignification of this worde,<note place="margin">B</note> 
                     <hi>Quotidianum,</hi> euery day without intermiſſion, euery day daily ſacrifice, euery day maſſe, euery day at the aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Then muſt you geue mee leaue as extremely to vrge theſe two ſillables <hi>Fruſtra,</hi> in vaine is oure oblation, in vaine is our ſacrificing, to no profite or commoditie is our maſſe, in vayne wée ſtande at the aulter, becauſe it is done
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4121:69"/>without company to receiue with vs. And ſurely, if a man rightly conſider this place, he may iuſtly meruaile, why ye would alledge it for priuate maſſe. For in déede there is no thinge, that hathe any colour for it, but only the wreaſted argument, that you wrynge out of the ſound of theſe wordes, <hi>Quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana obſatio,</hi> and <hi>Nemo eſt qui parbicipet:</hi> by the tone parte gatheringe, that the people then vſed to receiue only at Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, as they doo now: by the tother, that the prieſt receiued euery day, and there vpon conclude your ſole receiuinge. Which your collection of how ſmall ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte it is, any man may perceiue, if hee conſider theſe twoo thingꝭ before decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Firſt, that at that time all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters receiued together, as it ſhall be afterward more plainly proued by your owne teſtimonies. Secondly, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> I haue euidently ſhewed oute of Chriſoſtome him ſelfe, that many vſed to receiue at diuers other times of the yeare beſide
<pb facs="tcp:4121:70"/>Eaſter. For in déede hee doth not there blame the generall maner of all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, but of a number, that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted theim ſelfe either to Eaſter, or ſome other times, whether they were meete, or vnméete: And at other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſeaſons would not frequent the ſacramente, though they were more mete to receiue. But theſe were not al (as I ſayd) but a number of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people: and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſidew of the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſpoſed were ſo few, as oftentimes when the leſſons of ſcripture weare redde, when prayers and thankes ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing were made, when bread and wine were (as the maner was) offered vp for the communion: (whiche were the firſt partes of celebration as appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in Iuſtine) then he was compelled either to ſuffer the miniſters and cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie to receiure alone: or els for lacke of communicantꝭ to leaue of the reſidew of the miniſtration. And that is it, that be complaineth of, and ſaith is done in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:4121:70"/>vaine: becauſe it was vnperfitly done. For the preparinge to communion, the prayers and thankes geuinge for that purpoſe, the offeringe vp of breade and wine, the callinge of the people to it, may ſéeme to be in vayns, when none dyd come to participate with the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. Wherfore Chriſoſtome in this place doth not only nothinge confirme priuate maſſe, but alſo maketh very muche againſte it: and declareth, that hée toke the righte and trew vſe of the Lordes ſupper to bée, when the people were together partakers of the ſame. For if he had taken it as you doo, for an offeringe vp of the body of Chriſte for him ſelfe and the people, Or <hi>if hee had at ſuche tymes receiued alone, and thought it wel done,</hi> hee neither coulde nor would haue ſayd: <hi>Fruſtra babetur quotidiana obſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio, in vaine we haue our dayly offering,</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no other reaſon why it was vain, but becauſe the people at ſuche tymes dyd not receiue. Therfore it appeareth
<pb facs="tcp:4121:71"/>by thoſe wordes, both how neceſſary hee eſtemed the peoples communion, and alſo that hee toke not <hi>Oblatione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> for a propitiatorie ſacrifice, as you doo. For then he could not haue ſayde <hi>fruſtra habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> To this purpoſe it maketh, that the ſame Chriſoſtome in the ſame place ſo earneſtly calleth the people to it: as he ſaith to them: Whoſoeuer is not partaker of the miſteries, doth impudently and wicked<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly to ſtande there. And in the. <hi>17.</hi> Hom. vpon the epiſtle to the hebrewes, he ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the maner then was, that a deacon ſtode in a place higher then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and with a ſigne of his handes and a lowde voice called the people to the communion. This was not only at Eaſter, but at other times alſo. By this earneſt maner of calling, therfore it may appere how muche this doctour toke it to be of the ſubſtance of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, that a number ſhould be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of it: and how farre diuers hys maner was from the faſſhion of your
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:4121:71"/>priuate maſſe. Now then your amply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion, wherin ye clayme Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome to be wholy with you, ſheweth it ſelfe to be very vaine. And wée may now, as iuſtly ſay as wée did before, that ye haue no proofe out of the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fathers, for that ye doo herein ſo earneſtly defende: And that wée haue right good teſtimonies both out of the ſcripture and out of the Doctours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. For ye muſte not vſe to grounde doctrines vpon the coniecture of a few ſillables in one ſentence: but compare the ſame with diuers other places, as well of the ſame doctour, as of other, and al together with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vſe and maner of that time: and therby gather a perfit concluſion. If you will ſkanne and ſtay vpon euery worde or clauſe in the Doctours, as you doo of the holy ſcriptures, and not conſider them by conference with them ſelfe and other: you may eaſely erecte infinite new doctrines, that hitherto
<pb facs="tcp:4121:72"/>were neuer hearde of in the churche.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon,<note place="margin">6. Cap.</note> that you bring in, grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (as you ſay) vpon our principall, is euen of as muche force, as the other before mencioned.<note place="margin">A.</note> That is not eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently determined in ſcripture (ſay you) ought to ſtande as indifferente: but the neceſſitie of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie to receiue with the prieſt is no where determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: ergo it ought to remaine indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. Your ſeconde propoſition is not true. For I ſay, and partly before haue proued, that it is determined in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes inſtitucion. In Luke he ſaith, <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipite hoc &amp; diuidite inter vos.</hi> But how can it be taken at the miniſters handes and deuided or diſtributed amonge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnleſſe there be a companie. I ſe no ſufficient warrant, that ye can brynge vs for the diſcharge of this commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente. If ye wyll ſay <hi>Diuidite</hi> is no commaundement, but a counſell, that may be vndoone, and yet the ſubſtance of the ſacrament remaine: then bylike
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:4121:72"/>ye will ſay, Late, drinke, is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement: nor yet, do this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me. But all be indifferent cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels that may bee altered (as you after ſay) by ſpirituall gouernours. So that your ſpiritual gouernours may by this meanes cleane alter Chriſtes inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and leauinge out eatinge, drinking, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributinge, doinge in remembrance of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes death, (as they haue done) deuiſe a a new faſhion of their owne braynes more fitte for the churche to vſe, then that order which Chriſt hath lefte. But as he taketh away the right vſe of the ſacramente, that taketh away from it, eatynge, drinkynge, and doynge in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance. &amp;c. So I ſay that hee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away the ſame, that leaueth out diſtributynge. Whiche becauſe it can not be without companie, I conclude the Sacramente can not bee vſed in the celebration without companie.</p>
                  <p>Cyprian teacheth you, that Chriſtes inſtitution ſhould be of more authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb facs="tcp:4121:73"/>with you, than, ſo lightly, to change it at your owne pleaſure. Only Chriſt (ſaieth he) is to be hearde in the order of this ſacrament. And we muſt not in any wiſe departe from the preceptes of the Goſpell. The Apoſtle alſo more conſtantly and ſtoutly declareth in an other place, that the diſciples ought to obſerue and doo the ſame thynges, that their maiſter taught and dyd before them: ſaying in this wiſe. If ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I or an angell from heauen teach you o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then I haue taught you before, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed be he. Seyng therfore, neither the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle him ſelfe, nor an Angell from heauen can tell vs or teache vs otherwiſe, then that Chriſte hath once taught vs already, and the Apoſtle declared to vs: I meruayle how this came in vſe to doo contrary to that whiche Chriſte dyd. And what I pray you can be more contrarie, then, when Chriſte had them drinke, to take away the cup: and, whan Chriſte bad them diſtribute amonge them, and S. Paule willed one to tarrie for an other, vntill they came together: yet contrarie to this (as you doo) to miniſter and receiue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:4121:73"/>Therfore I ſay with Cyprian, that in alteryng the ſacrament, either by ſoole receiuyng or géeuing vnder one kinde, ye worſhip God in vayne with mens tradicions. The mattier that Cyprian wrote againſt (that is) vſinge of water alone in the Sacramente in ſtéede of wyne, might perhappes, in caſe of neceſſitie, be graunted to ſome, that of nature coulde not abide wyne. Neuertheleſſe the neceſſitie of a few is not to be drawen to a general example in the common vſe of the Lordes ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Euen ſo it may be graunted that in caſes of neceſſitie one may receiue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: and yet that is not to be taken for a common maner and faſhion in the churche, when the ſacrament is ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated, as you vſed in the priuate Maſſe. That many circumſtancies of place, perſon, and time,<note place="margin">B.</note> may be altered or taken away for good conſiderations, without impeachement to the right vſe of the ſacramentes, wée graunte you:
<pb facs="tcp:4121:74"/>but that company in receiuyng is one of thoſe circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtances, that wée can not graunte: as well for the reaſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore declared, as alſo that wée haue no aucthoritée or example of the Apoſtles or primatiue churche, that wée may ſo doo, as wée haue in all other thynges that you recite with moe wordes then néedeth. Wée dare miniſter in other places then Iurie, becauſe wée ſe in ſcripture, that the Apoſtles did ſo.</p>
                  <p>Wée miniſter to women and lay men: becauſe S. Paule applieth Chriſtes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitucion to the whole congregacion of Corinth: where were both lay men &amp; women. We celebrate vpon any day indifferently, becauſe the Apoſtles did ſo, <hi>Actum. <hi>20.</hi> vno die ſabbatorum.</hi> Wée miniſter to fewer or moe then twelue, by the example of the Apoſtles in <hi>.20.</hi> of the Actes, and of Paule in <hi>.10.</hi> and <hi>.11.</hi> to the Corinthꝭ. Wée receiue in the mornyng, both becauſe time is a thyng indifferent in this ſacrament, and alſo
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:4121:74"/>for that wée haue plaine examples in the primatiue churche, without caſe of neceſſitie or extraordinarie chaunſes. Chriſte ſayd not doo it after ſupper, as he ſayde, Deuide it amonge you. He did it after ſupper him ſelf: becauſe he wolde inſtitute the Sacramente of the new law, in place of the ſacrament of tholde law, that at the ſame ſupper he had ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated. Neither is it ſo muche of the ſubſtance of the ſacrament to be doone after ſuppper, as it is to be celebrated with companie: becauſe of the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacion of vnitie and charitie amonge chriſtian men receiuynge together.</p>
                  <p>Whiche is one cheefe poincte in this ſacrament of the Lordes ſupper. The very proporcion and likeneſſe of that ceremonie of the olde lawe, in place whereof the Lordes ſupper is ordeined, may teache vs the right vſe of it. The Paſſeouer was a ſolempne eatynge of the Paſcale lambe together in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Godes great benefite of their
<pb facs="tcp:4121:75"/>deliuerance and paſſyng of his plague from them. This ceremony they coulde not ſolempnice alone: but if they had not companie of their owne houſe, they ſhoulde take of their neighbours. Euen in like maner Chriſt, hauyng finiſſhed at his laſte ſupper the celebracion of that ceremonie of the Paſſeouer, ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for his, euen a lyke ſacramente, a ſupper, a feaſt, wherin they, beyng to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, might celebrate the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their redemption, by his body and bloud géeuen and ſhed for them. And euen as the Iewes in ſolempni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinge their ſacrament had a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the remembrance of that bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, when their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies were in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry howſes ſeperate, and yet might not one alone eate the paſcall lambe in his owne houſe, for that god had ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it to be done with company: ſo all the churches in the worlde haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie in the ſacrament, bee they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo farre a ſunder: and yet can not
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4121:75"/>any one alone miniſter it in one church withoute company to celebrate with him, becauſe Chriſtes inſtitution was otherwiſe. Wil ye ſay here, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to eate vp the paſcal lambe was not of the ſubſtance of the ſacramente, but an ornament to commend it or ſet it forth, and might be altered by ſpiry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual gouernours? Although the Iewes weare very bolde in altering many ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, yet wée reade not, that euer they durſt aulter this chiefe ſacrament: as you take vpon you to alter, change and take away, by your ſpirituall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours, all the partes of the Lordes Supper: as I wyl declare to you in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by the doctrine of this your defenſe of pryuate maſſe. The ſacrament, as it is in vſe, hath two partes, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, and the forme: the mattier is bread and the body, wine and the bloud of Chriſt. The forme of miniſtration is, that the miniſter ſhould take the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, and with the wordes of the goſpel
<pb facs="tcp:4121:76"/>geue it to them preſent, as Chriſt dyd. This forme (ſay you) may be altered by your ſpiritual gouernours. For ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time the prieſte may receiue alone with out the people, ſometime the people without the prieſt: ſomtime both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So that no certaine forme of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration is nedefull (as you ſay) in this ſacrament to be kepte. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier alſo, ye ſignifie, may bee altered at your pleaſure. For, to receiue the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the bloud, is not of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Chriſtes inſtitution. For, if it weare, the churche could not alter it, as you doo commonly in miniſtringe to the people, and as you coniecture by <hi>Tertuſ.</hi> and <hi>Ciprian,</hi> that they dyd in the prymatiue church. Likewyſe the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the body is not ſo muche of the ſubſtance, but that vpon conſiderations the church may commonly omitte it, and miniſter the wine only. For ſo you ſéeme togather by the hiſtory of the chylde, in <hi>Ciprian,</hi> to whiche the prieſte
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:4121:76"/>gaue only wine, as you ſay. So that the ſacrament of the lordes ſupper, by your doctrine, either hath no parte, that is of the ſubſtance of it, but conſiſteth only of mutable accidences: or els your chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is of ſuch power, that it may cleane alter and take away Chriſtes inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For if you haue conſiderations, for which ye may commonly leaue out the wine, and vſe bread only: and other conſiderations, for which ye may omit breade, and vſe wine only: when bothe thoſe conſiderations come together, then may you take away bothe breade and wine, and defraude the people of the whole ſacrament, or in ſtede of that may point them another. What is this but, with exceding arrogancie, to make your ſpiritual gouernours omnipotent in alteringe and tranſpoſinge the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes by Chriſt ordeyned? Howe much more comely weare it for you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoking your errour: to ſay with Cipri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. If we wil walke in the ſight of Chriſte,

As amonge Marchantes, that vpon certaine condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions occupy iointly, and are partakers of like gaine and damage. So all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian men haue a certaine ſocietie or coniunction: whiche conſiſteth in this, that they are all partakers of one ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and all members of one miſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal body, the head wherof is chriſt Ieſu. The lawes &amp; couenantes, wherby wée be all thus knit and ioigned together, are the word of God, &amp; the ſacramentꝭ vſed according to Chriſtes inſtitucion. Therefore all churches of the worlde haue the ſame worde of God, and the ſame ſacramentes: &amp; by them through faith are graffed into one and the ſame body of Chriſte, thoughe they be thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandes of miles a ſunder. By the word of God our faith is inſtructed: By bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme wée be receiued firſt into the ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie
<pb facs="tcp:4121:79"/>of chriſtian communion, and made members of the miſticall body. By the Lordes ſupper wée haue from time to time, heauenly foode miniſtred vnto vs, and, as it were, liuely ſpirite from the head of this body Ieſu Chriſte. He therfore, that is baptiſed in India, hath the ſame baptiſme that wee haue: and, beyng graffed into the ſame body, hath communion with vs in baptiſme. Likewiſe they, that receiue the Lordes ſupper, be fedde with the ſame feede of the body and bloud of Chriſte, that wée be: and ſo haue communion with vs in that ſacrament, though in place they be farre of. This is the communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene chriſtian men: and this wée moſt reddely graunte. But will you conclude here vpon, that there is lyke communion of the benefite of ſoole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuyng in priuate Maſſe, as there is of praier, when a man praieth alone? Then muſt ye ſay the ſame of baptiſme alſo. As for example, that our baptiſme
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:4121:79"/>here may benefite ſome, that are in Fraunce, and receiue them into the churche: like as our praier here may obteine the healpe and grace of God for them, that be there. Which were great folly to affirme. In déed wée haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in baptiſme: but euery mans owne baptiſme bringeth him the grace of that ſacrament. And in lyke maner is it in the Lordes ſupper. Wée haue all communion therein: and yet euery mans owne receiuyng doth profit him. You will ſay perhaps, you doo not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre this vpon the argument of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall communion, but onely that they, whiche be in diuers places, may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate.

<pb facs="tcp:4121:80"/>praieth not, may haue benefit by one mans praier. But proue you by Gods worde, that one man receiuyng or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtringe the Lordes ſupper alone, doth benefit thoſe that receiue not, or that it is ſuche a thyng as may be doone of no for many. And ſurely, it ſtandeth you vpon, ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cially to proue that pointe, or els your priuate Maſſe will fall to the grounde, and bee of no eſtimacion. For if people ſhall vnderſtande, that your ſole receiuinge in your Maſſe doth not only nothing profite them, that be preſent: but (as Chriſoſtome witneſſeth) bringeth them in gods diſpleaſure, if they receiue not them ſelfe: thinke you that the gayne and aduantage thereof wyll bée ſo great, as hath bene before? Aſſure your ſelfe it wyl not. But what doo you inferre vpon this proofe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion betweene them that are in place farre diſtante: forſoth in effecte, this. That if there may be communion betwene thoſe that are not together in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:4121:80"/>one place: then a prieſt, ſayinge Maſſe in our Lady chappel in Paules at ſixe a clocke in the morning, doth commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with him, that doth the like in Ieſus Churche at .ix. of the clocke the next day: although in place and tyme they bee ſeperate. Sir I deny your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, &amp; ſay that neither thone nor thother doth communicate with any Chriſtian man, becauſe neither of both receiueth accordinge to Chriſtes inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. I confeſſe there is communyon betwene them, that receiue in ſundry places according to the order by Chriſt apoynted, as there is likewiſe in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. But, if they alter the ſacrament, they doo not cummunicate. I ſayd a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before, that in the paſſe ouer all the companies of the Iewes in ſundry houſes did communicate, and yet one might not eate vp the lambe alone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe god had taken an other order. Likewiſe all ſocietées of Chriſtian men communicate together in the Lordes
<pb facs="tcp:4121:81"/>ſupper: and yet ſhould not one celebrate it alone, ſeinge Chriſtes example ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, and the Apoſtles interpretation declareth, that in miniſtringe of it, there ſhouſd bee alſo a particuler com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion (as I may terme it) betwene the members of one congregation. Wherfore the grauntinge of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie betweene all chriſtian men in vſe of the ſacrament, doth make nothinge againſt this, that Chriſt ordeined it to be receiued as a feaſt with company: to thende it might more liuely repreſent, both the general giuing and beſtowing of his body to death for many, and alſo the vnitie and concorde, that ought to be betwéene Chriſtian men, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing together of one loſe and one cup. For this purpoſe, as S. Auguſtine ſignifieth, he vſed thoſe externall ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of breade and wine: to declare, that, as the bread of many graines is brought into one lofe, and the iuice of many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The like effecte is doone in baytiſme (as S. Auguſtine witneſſeth <hi>In ſermone ad infantes</hi>) and wée be graffed into Chriſt and made partakers of his body and bloud. But he wold haue it more liuely repreſented and ſet foorthe in this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of communion: as well for the multitude, as for the apte ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the externall elementes. More ouer the eccleſiaſtical hiſtories declare, when Chriſoſtome was baniſſhed, muche againſt the peoples heartes, that diuers of them woulde not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with his ſucceſſour, but had their aſſembles and receiued the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in an other place by them ſelues, ſo that diuers of them by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours thretnynges coulde not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreined to communicate with him,
<pb facs="tcp:4121:82"/>that was biſſhop after him. This their dooyng was to no purpoſe, if diuerſitie of time and place doo not declare a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peracion betwéen them, that be of one congregacion. The whole vſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication in the primatiue chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che doth ſo ſufficiently proue this, as no reaſonable man néedeth greatly to doubte it. The effecte wherof, this your deuiſe may ſéeme to take away. For what other thyng is excommunication (as touchyng the externall acte) then a debarryng of the partie to receiue with other of the ſame congregacion, and therby to note him not to be of that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall body. But after your deuiſe, a prieſt, that is excommunicated of the biſſhop, may ſay Maſſe in his chamber, and affirme that he will communicate with him, whether he will or no. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe diſtinction of place maketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng to the purpoſe. Becauſe wée ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily require a numbre together, you preſſe vpon the mattier very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:4121:82"/>and thinke, by your dalliyng fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to driue vs to many folies. For, you curiouſly require a meſure of place, a preſcription of time, and a certaine number of perſons: as it were therby to portray vnto you a perfit plat of a chriſtian communion (for ſo it pleaſeth you to dally in this weightie mattier.) I anſwer that wée ſe in the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtes and S. Paule, that Chriſte tooke breade and gaue with it his body: that he tooke wine alſo and gaue with it his bloud: that he did it in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient place and time: that he had a company with him to receiue, and willed them to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute amonge them. Therfore (with S. Cyprian) wée compte his example in theſe thynges neceſſarie, and not to be altered. As for the kinde of breade or wine, the faſhion or quantitie of place, the conueniencie of time, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing or deminiſſhynge of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or company, wee recken amonge thoſe thinges that may be altered (as
<pb facs="tcp:4121:83"/>you ſay) by ſpiritual gouernours. But to apointe a geometricall meaſure of place, a preſcripte proportion of tyme, or one certaine number, that may ſerue for all churches, times, and ages, is far aboue our reache. And therfore I leaue it to be deuiſed of ſuche profound and curious braines, as you and yours haue. Which, beſide the worde of god, and contrary to his workynge in his creatures, can compryſe accidences without ſubiectes, and bodies withoute faſhion, qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tity or meaſure, with other ſuche highe miſteries, whiche neither ſcripture, nor any neceſſitie of reaſon doth teache.

For euery Paynime, eſpecially if his wyfe, childe, or ſeruaunt, were tourned to Chriſtianitie, was ready and ſought occaſion to bewray them, and bringe them in trouble (as it may
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:4121:84"/>appere by the ſame booke of Tertullian that you alledge). Therfore they were oftentimes compelled of neceſſitie to ſend the ſacrament to ſuch as were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and either durſt not or might not conueniently come: as ye may perceiue by Iuſtine the Martir that the faſhion was in his time. Hereof it came, that dyuers receiued alone in their houſes. But nor theſe places, nor any other, that you be able to alledge, can proue, that there were miniſters or prieſtes priuately celebratinge with other ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge bie, that receiued not. That, whiche theſe perſons receiued at home, was parte of that was diſtributed in the common celebration where compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were: and, vppon caſe of neceſſitée, ſent by the miniſters to them beinge abſent. But you ſhould bringe ſuch pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as might proue, that the common miniſter, in place of the lordes ſupper, dyd celebrate and receiue alone, other beinge preſent and not partaking. For
<pb facs="tcp:4121:85"/>ſuche a ſole receiuinge is your pryuate Maſſe, that you pretende to ſtriue for. Now therefore let vs ſée, how aptely your argument, gathered vppon theſe places, doeth conclude your purpoſe. Women and lay men ſomtime, in caſe of neceſſitie, priuately receiued at home parte of that, which was ſent from the common celebration: therfore common miniſters, as often as they liſte, oute of neceſſitie may conſecrate, and receiue alone in the common place of prayer, when the people is preſent, and doth not communicate. I thinke your ſelfe may eaſely ſe, of what force this col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection is. That may be graunted to a lay perſon receiuinge, that may not to a pryeſt miniſtringe: that ſometime in neceſſitie, whiche may not alwayes at pleaſure: that at home where none is, that may not in the church where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny be. Wherfore theſe teſtimonies are but weake groundes to builde pryuate Maſſe vppon. You wyll perchance ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:4121:85"/>that ſuch receiuing in houſes was vſed, when the churche was in quiet, and without perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I graunt you, (as the maner is) that facions, brought in by neceſſitie or ſome greate conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, be oftentimes kept and folowed with abuſe, when neither neceſſitie doth conſtraine it, nor good conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion can mainteine it: and ſo was it in this matter. Hierome againſt <hi>Iouini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> mencioneth, that in his time ſome vſed to receiue in their houſes: but he earneſtly inueigheth againſt that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Why (ſaith he) doe they not come into the church? he Chriſt ſometime abrode in the common place, ſomtime at home in the houſe? &amp;c. In <hi>Socrates</hi> the. <hi>2.</hi> boke, we reade, that <hi>Sinodus Gangrenſis</hi> condemned <hi>Euſtathium</hi> for that, contrary to the eccleſiaſtical rules, he graunted licence to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate at home. So that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it may apeare, that a cuſtome, that, in neceſſitie, to ſome perſons, is eyther tollerable, <hi>or pius error:</hi> is at another
<pb facs="tcp:4121:86"/>time, and to other perſons vntollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and <hi>Impia prophanatio.</hi> If you dily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently examine that maner of recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge in theyr houſes at that tyme, which ye thinke to make with you, you ſhal wel perceiue it not a lytle to make againſt you. When they did celebrate (as Iuſtine before rehearſed doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) they dyd not only diſtribute to them, that were preſente, but, by the deatons, ſent it to ſuch, as could not be preſent. Did they not in this point de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare a neceſſitée of partakinge, if it were poſſible at euery miniſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? In ſo muche that when their place would not receiue all, or other neceſſary cauſe did let them to come to the common place of prayer: yet, that they might be partakers of the Lordes ſupper, they ſent it to them where they were. How well doth this faſhion agree with your priuate maſſe? Wherin ye neither cal, nor proffer, nor ſend to the people: but ſo doo it all alone in ſight of the hole
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:4121:86"/>congregacion, as though it weare a thinge, that nothing appertained vnto them. Now then you may euidently ſe, that none of theſe aucthorities, hether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to alleged, doth prove directly your Maſſe: that is a ſole receiuinge in the celebration of the ſacrament. But how neceſſary that time of the churche dyd thinke it to bee, that the people ſhould bee partakers with the prieſte, that Epiſtle ſignitieth, that you attribute to <hi>Anacletus:</hi> where it is this wrytten. <hi>Peracta conſecratione omnes communicent, qui noluerit eccleſiaſticis carere liminibus.

                     </gap>lde place of refuge: that is, that, to receiue vnder bothe kindes; is not of the ſubſtance of the ſacrament, but ſuch a thynge as may be altered by ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all gouernours. For Chriſtes bodie
<pb facs="tcp:4121:88"/>(ſay you) is not without his bloud, &amp; therfore he, that receiueth his body vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der forme of breade, receiueth his bloud alſo, <hi>Per concomitantiam.</hi> Therfore you ſay the people is not defrauded of that Chriſtes will was, that they ſhoulde receiue, yea and, for good conſideraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; honorable to the bloud of Chriſt, they receiue it more conuenient then vnder bothes kindes. O profounde and déepe ſette reaſon, wherin you ſéeme to make your ſelfe wiſer than Chriſte him ſelfe, that ordeined the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. While you will ſéeme with your gay gloſes to glorifie the bloud of Chriſte, you cleane take away the right forme and maner of his ſacramente. Theſe are the vanities wherwith God iuſtly doeth puniſh you for your raſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in leauyng his worde and folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> phantaſies of your owne braine. But it ſhould haue béen your obedience to Goddes worde to conſider, that the communion of Chriſtꝭ body and bloud
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:4121:88"/>is not the worke of nature in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. For, what ſo euer is here ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in theſe thynges, is to be taken by faith: and is offered to vs in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of Chriſtes promiſſes. So much is geuen vs as God appoincted to giue. Of whoſe will and pleaſure wée know no more, then his wordes declare vnto vs. But Chriſt (as I ſaied) tooke twoo partes of the ſacrament: in one of the whiche he ſaied wée ſhoulde be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of his body: in the tother of his bloud, and lefte his preſcripte and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poincted wordes, as well for the tone as for the tother. Wherfore wée muſt more truſt him than mans ſubtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe. You alledge a perpetuall ſocietie of the body and bloud, whiche ye call <hi>Concomitantiam.</hi> It is your owne deuiſe and not Chriſtes promiſſe in his ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In Chriſtes naturall body, that is in heauen, I know his fleſh is not without his bloud. But in the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente, whiche is no naturall worke,
<pb facs="tcp:4121:89"/>how will you aſſure me, that the fleſh and bloud is ioinctly ſignified and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to mee vnder one parte onely: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng Chriſt himſelf, who knew, as wel as you, the ioincte condicion of his fleſh and bloud, did notwithſtandyng, in twoo ſundrie external thinges, geue the communion of them to his diſciples. Therefore the faieth of the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantes in the tone parte receiueth the body of Chriſte, truſtynge to Chriſtes promiſſes: The ſame faith in the other parte receiueth the bloud, beléeuyng al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo our ſauiours wordes therin. It hath reſpecte to Chriſtes wordes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes, it looketh not how the body and bloud is in Chriſte naturally. What grounde ſhal our faith haue if we leaue the worde of God? Oh ye will ſay our holy mother the churche hath ſo ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it. Yea, but I ſay to you, that, if your mother the churche of Rome be the folde of Chriſte, and if the ſhéepe therof be his ſhéepe, they will heare his
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:4121:89"/>voyce and obey his worde. If they doo not, alledge the name as ofte as ye wyll, I will ſay you be ſhéepe of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther folde and not of his. For he ſaith, <hi>Oues meae vocem meam audiunt.</hi> He ſaith not they heare them ſelfe &amp; their owne deuiſes, but they heare my voyce. Remember what Cyprian ſaith. Only Chriſte is to be hearde in this. And wee muſt not looke what other did before vs, but what Chriſte did before all other. When we doubt, we muſt haue recourſe to the order ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by Chriſte and by the Apoſtles in their wrytinge. But ye will ſay the churche hath aucthoritie to alter diuers thinges eſpecially beyng indifferent, and not of the ſubſtance of the ſacramente. Yea but Cyprian ſaith the preceptes of this ſacrament bee <hi>Grandia &amp; magna.</hi> And if he be called leaſt in the kingdome of god, that altereth one of the leaſt commaundementes, what ſhalbe ſayd of him, that taketh awaye theſe great and weightie commaundementes. Ciprian wrate againſt thoſe that were called <hi>Aquarij,</hi> water drinkers: which
<pb facs="tcp:4121:90"/>vſed only water in ſtede of wine in the miniſtration of the ſacrament. But they offended not ſo much as you doe. For they altered only the licour, and that vppon holy conſiderations. They kepte the wordes and promyſſes of Chriſte. But you take away the one parte cleane, and leaue out the wordes and moſte comfortable promyſſes of Chriſtes bloud to bee ſhed for vs. If then Cyprian were ſo earneſt againſte thoſe vſers of water in ſtéede of wyne, how muche more earneſt woulde hee haue ben againſte this maner, if it had ben common in his time? Here, thoſe places that you recite may ſéeme to helpe you, and to make againſte vs. For, where Tertullian ſpeaketh of the Paynimes wife, hee mencioneth bread only. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ciprian reporteth that the woman kept the lordes body in her coffer, it may ſéeme to be vnder one kinde. Theſe are but coniectures, and the ſame very vncertaine. For often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:4121:90"/>in the doctours, where one kinde is mencioned, both are vnderſtanded, as after ſhal more appere. But to make this more probable: you alledge after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde oute of Ambroſe the hyſtorie of <hi>Satyrus</hi> his brother, that hanged the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament aboute his necke in a ſtole (as you call it,) when, in a ſhipwarke, he leaped into the ſea: whiche muſt néedꝭ be informe of bread onely, becauſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our brayne nor yours can deuyſe, which way wyne can be in ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument incloſed. Surely if wée had not knowen before, that you had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the aunciente fathers directly to mainteine your maymynge of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes ſacrament: this your coniectural gatherynges and ſurmiſinge reaſons woulde moſt euidently declare it to be true. Woulde a man thinke that any, hauyng the feare of God, woulde in ſo weightie mattiers, either grounde his owne conſcience, or ſéeke to confirme others by ſuche féeble proofes and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentes?
<pb facs="tcp:4121:91"/>Is not this a ſtronge rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thinke you? <hi>Satyrus</hi> S. Ambroſe brother, in extreame danger of ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrake, purpoſing to leape into the ſea, tooke of one, that was in the ſhip, only the ſacramente of the Lordes body, and tied it aboute his necke: therfore in the primatiue churche in miniſtration of the ſacramente they gaue onely one kinde vnto the laytie. Though it had ben here mencioned that <hi>Satyrus</hi> had, in this extremitée, receiued one kinde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: it had bene no argument to proue, that it might orderly bee vſed in the churche. But (as Ambroſe ſignifieth) this <hi>Satyrus</hi> at that time was, but, as I might ſay, a nouice in Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, not ſo farre inſtructed in the faith that hee was as then admitted to the communion of the Lordes ſupper. And therfore hee had not the ſacramente a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute him ſelfe, but tooke it of other chriſtian men, that were there. Which whether they were miniſters or other,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:4121:91"/>the place maketh no mencion: but that it calleth them, <hi>Initiatos.</hi> That is, ſuch as in the congregation were admitted to the communion. Neither is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinge to the contrary, but that the ſame perſons, whiche had the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Lordes body, had alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute them the ſacrament of the bloud, either in ſome conuenient veſſel, or els after ſome other faſhion, as dyuers of ſimplicitie vppon a zeale at that tyme vſed. That is either by ſokinge the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramente of the body in the wyne, or els by moyſtinge a linnen-cloth in the ſacrament of the bloud, and ſo carying it with them. For, euen as I ſignified before, that perſecution and trouble of the churche at the beginninge draue ſome to receiue at home in their houſes: in like maner the ſame troublous time, and other caſes of neceſſitie with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uencie of zeale, cauſed men to ſeke o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhifts alſo, and to doo thoſe things by ſimplicitie vpon zeale at a time, that
<pb facs="tcp:4121:92"/>in the common vſe of the ſacramentes they coulde not doo accordinge to the worde of god. Therfore as ſome lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and holy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the time did winke and beare with ſuche thinges: ſo after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde other euen as holy and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly learned did miſlike and reproue the ſame. As for example, when men did trauaile any daungerous iourney, and for zeale and deuotion would haue the ſacrament with them: becauſe they could not conueniently cary wine with them, that they might go as nighe to Chriſtes inſtitution as might be, they would ſoke the ſacrament of our Lordꝭ body in the bloud. Some other would moyſte a linnen cloth in the ſacrament of bloud (as I ſaid before) and kepe it to moyſte with water when they would receiue. Some, that either of nature could not, or for religion would not drinke wine, at other times vſed only water. Some vppon other conſideraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vſed milke for wine in the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:4121:92"/>Some were perſwaded that in ſuch caſes men might vſe one kynde. Wherfore to ſicke men or children they would vſe wine alone. But the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular caſes of a few, ought not to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a general rule of the holy chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che. Neither thoſe thinges, which ſome did (as Ciprian termeth it) vppon ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie by ſufferance, ſhould be brought as teſtimonies, what the church either then did, or ought nowe commonly to doo. For a man may well doubte whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe ſhiftes, that men in neceſſitie did vſe beſide the inſtitution of Chriſt, were acceptable to god or no, although dyuers of them might ſéeme to procede of a feruent zeale, and to bee done of good and godly men. It appereth in <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> that many of them, that vſed wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for wine, were godly men: and yet by zeale and ſimplicitie did erre. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee ſaith of them in this manner. If any of our prediceſſours either by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or ſimplicitie did not obſerue and kepe that, whiche the lorde by his example and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
<pb facs="tcp:4121:93"/>did teach vs to doe: by gode mercy his ſimplicitie may be pardoned. But we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be forgeuen, which be inſtructed &amp; admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſhed by the lorde to doe as he dyd. &amp;c. The godly and holy fathers dyd beare in many poyntes with the zeale and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie of a number, in that tyme. Wherfore thoſe examples cannot bee brought iuſtly to proue the common maner vſed in the primatiue churche, which by manifeſt teſtimonies I wyll a lytle after declare to haue be farre o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwyſe in the ſame times, that theſe thinges were done. That the ſame thinges, before rehearſed, were not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally allowed, it may appeare by this, that, when the church was ſetled, they did forbid thoſe things, and bound them, ſo nigh as might bee, to Chriſtes inſtitution. Hereof ye haue example in <hi>Iulius</hi> his decrées. <hi>1. Hom. Conc.</hi> Wher all the faſhions before recited are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely forbidden. Wee heare (ſaith he) that ſome led with ſchiſmaticall ambition, in the diuine miſteries doe conſecrate milke for
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:4121:93"/>wine: ſome ſerue to the people the ſacrament of the body moyſted in the bloud, as a perfite communion: other offer in the ſacramente of the lordes cuppe, the iuice of grapes ſquiſed: ſome diepe a linnen cloth in the wine, and kepe all the yere. Therefore (ſaith he) henceforth it ſhat not be lawful for any in their ſacrifice to offer any other thinge, but only the cuppe mixed with water and wine. <hi>Gelaſius</hi> alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him euen as flatly forbad receiuing vnder one kinde: ſayinge. We finde that ſome takinge a portion of the fordes body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the cuppe: whiche, becauſe I know not of what ſuperſtition they doe it, either let them take the whole ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or be kept from the whole. For the diuiſion of this miſtery can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without great ſacrilege. Here you ſée that <hi>Gelaſius</hi> doth count it and cal it ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege to receiue vnder one kinde: and your ſorte contrary to this, affirme it to be Heriſie, if a man ſay the people ſhould receiue vnder both kindes of bread and wyne. If you would rightly haue proued your miniſtringe to the laytie in one kynde: you ſhold not haue brought coniectures vppon ſuche rare
<pb facs="tcp:4121:94"/>chaunſes, as may ſéeme for the tyme to be borne with, rather then alowed: but you ſhould haue ſhewed ſome playne and euident examples, that it was in the primatiue church commonly vſed in celebration of the ſacrament. But that you were neuer able to doo, and ſo was it ſaid in the proteſtation, that you call the challenge. For herein the whole number of the fathers be againſt you. And that you may not iuſtly ſay, that wee bragge of our empty boxes, that haue the name only, and no ſtuffe in them: I wyll rechearſe and ſhewe you ſome of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mattier, which ſhalbe direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applied to that maladie and diſeaſe, that you haue brought to the right vſe of the lordes holy ſacrament. You hard before rehearſed oute of <hi>Iuſtine</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe the maner of the church of Rome in his time, that both bread and wyne were geuen to companies of the towne and contrey, and the ſame alſo ſente vnto thoſe, that were abſent. Here is
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:4121:94"/>manifeſtly declared, that ſuch as were abſent, and receiued at home in theyr houſes, had both kindes ſent vnto them, contrary to your coniecture vpon <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> where (you ſay) one kinde only is mencioned and therefore receiued. <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Iuſtine</hi> were both of the church of Rome,<note place="margin">B.</note> and were not in time farre a ſunder. Therfore it is like one maner was vſed in bothe theyr ages. The fleaſh (ſaith <hi>Tertullian</hi> him ſelfe) is fed with the body and bloud, that the ſoule may be filled of god. He ſaith not only the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, wherein the bloud alſo may be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanded: but hee addeth ſeperately the Bloud. Declaringe the maner of Chriſtes ſacrament miniſtred in two ſundry partes. <hi>Cyprian</hi> alſo ſpeakinge not only of prieſtes, but of other laye men, that were like to abide perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and martirdome for Chriſt, ſaith in this wiſe. How doe wee teach and prouoke them to ſhedde their bloud in confeſſion of Chriſt, if wee deny them his bloud. or bowe make we them meete for the cuppe of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirdome,
<pb facs="tcp:4121:95"/>if wee do not firſt by communion ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte them to drinke the cuppe of the lorde? Is not this a playne teſtimony,<note place="margin">C.</note> what maner of myniſtracion was vſed in <hi>Cyprians</hi> time? And wyll you then, vpon a ſurmiſe, gather the contrary? If ye rede this father in all places, where he ſpeaketh of the ſacrament: you ſhall finde nothinge more common, then, <hi>Bibi ſanguinem Chriſti.</hi> How wiſie thou (ſaith Ambroſe to <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour) with thoſe hands receiue the holy body of our lord? how wilte thou be ſo bolde, with thy mouth to be partaker of the lords bloud. This Emperour was a laye man:<note place="margin">E.</note> ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it likely, that he receiued any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwayes, then the other people did at that time. And ſhall wee thinke by a vayne coniecture of the hiſtory of <hi>Sati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> that the cuſtome of that time was otherwiſe, becauſe your mocking head could not deuiſe how to cary wyne in a ſtole? and yet they of that time (as ye may perceiue by dipping a linnen cloth in the ſacrament of the bloud) had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyſed
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:4121:95"/>which way it might be done. But to our purpoſe. Withoute confuſion and doubt (ſaith <hi>Gregory Nazienzene</hi>) eate his body and drinke his bloud, if thou haue any deſire of life in thee. And yet hee ſpeaketh to the people, <hi>Oratione. 4. in ſanctum paſcha. Hilariꝰ</hi> alſo. <hi>li. 8. de trinitate.</hi> Theſe thinges (ſaith hee) beinge eaten and dronke make that wee be in Chriſt and Chriſte in vs. <hi>Baſile de baptiſmo,</hi> vpon theſe wordes. As often as ye ſhall eate. &amp;c. What profit haue thoſe wordes (ſaith he)? That we eaſing and drinking may be perpetually mindeful of him that died for vs: and ſo may bee inſtructed in the ſight of god and his Chriſt, of neceſſitie to kepe the doctrine deliuered by his Apoſtles. Here, beſide the mencion both of eating and drinkinge, he addeth, of neceſſitie to kepe this doctrine of the lordes ſupper: whiche you in many poyntes, without pricke of conſcience take vppon you to aulter. Pryſtes (ſaith. <hi>S. Hieronime</hi> vpon <hi>Sophon</hi>) whiche make the ſacrament and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute the bloud of the lord vnto the people. This man was prieſt in Rome in Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſes time: and yet he ſignifieth, that
<pb facs="tcp:4121:96"/>the maner then was to myniſter the bloud to the people.<note place="margin">E.</note> And ſhall the hiſtory of <hi>Satyrus,</hi> nothing perteining to the mattier, perſwade vs the contrary? What can be more plaine and expreſly againſt you, then that Chriſoſtom hath <hi>Hom. 18. in poſter. ad corinth?</hi> There he ſaieth, that in this ſacramente the prieſtes parte, is not better then the peoples. For it is not (ſaith he) as it was in the olde law, where the prieſtes had parte and the people parte: neither coulde the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be partaker of that was the prieſtes. But now it is not ſo, for one body and one cuppe is indifferently offered to all. And it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table that he ſaieth. All be like worthy to be partakers, neither doth the inferiour differ any thing at all fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the prieſt in that matter. Why doo you then (ſo plainly againſte Chriſoſtome) make difference of digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie betwéene the prieſt and the people? Is not this, which Chriſoſtom ſpeaketh agaynſt, one of the chiefeſt reaſons, that you haue for the geuynge of one kynde to the people? But S. Paule to <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> declareth other
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:4121:96"/>cauſes that ſhoulde make the order of miniſterie honorable: &amp; not to defraude the people of one parte of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacrament. <hi>Cyprian</hi> againe, in the ſame ſermon <hi>De lapſis,</hi> that you afterward aledge, and the ſame Hyſtorie, ſheweth, that all the companie of lay men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men tooke the ſacrament of the Lordes cuppe and dronke of it in order, one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an other. But I feare I ſhal ſéeme to moſte men to commit muche foly, in that I ſtande ſo longe with aucthori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to proue that thinge, whiche of it ſelfe is moſt manyfeſt: that is, that in the primatiue churche the only maner, in the common celebracion of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, was, that all receiued vnder bothe kindes of breade and wyne. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge therefore Iuſtine ſaieth, that on ſundaies breade and wine conſecrated were diſtributed to companies of the towne and countrey, ſeynge <hi>Gelaſius</hi> calleth it ſacrilege to deuide the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſeynge <hi>Cyprian</hi> counſelleth that
<pb facs="tcp:4121:97"/>lay men ſhould be admitted to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Lordes cuppe, and by an Hyſtorie ſheweth that in his time they vſed it: ſeynge Chriſoſtome affirmeth no difference to be betweene the prieſt and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people in vſe of this ſacramente: ſeyng all the reſidue of the fathers of al countreyes and all ages of the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue churche agrée to the ſame, were it not more then willfull blindeneſſe not to ſe, that holy men at that time in ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebracion of the ſacramente miniſtred both partes to the people, accordyng to Chriſtes inſtitucion and the doctrine of S. Paule to the Corinth? Were it not almoſte deſperate ſtubburneſſe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the contrarie to ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and by libelles priuily ſpred to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine the vnlearned in errour? But it ſtoode you vpon to ſay ſomewhat, leaſt you ſhoulde ſéeme to haue nothynge to ſay. And yet in very déede it had been better for the confirmacion of your doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine to haue ſayd nothyng. For then
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:4121:97"/>perhaps ſuch, as of ſimplicitie depende vpon your aucthorities, woulde haue thought, that you had had farre better prouiſion for your defence in ſo weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie mattiers. Which now, ſeyng your ſelender and féeble groundes, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne, I doubte not, as they haue the feare of God, to miſtruſt your dealyng, and more diligently examine the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due of your doctrine. It is not good for them any lenger to walke on other mens féete, nor to be guided by other mens eyes, but them ſelfe to ſe what way they go: leaſt their guides, either by ignorance or wilfulneſſe, leade them into the pitte of continuall errour.</p>

Ye ſir, I thinke they as good men, were ſo perſwaded: but that they did leaue in writyng many thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, not onely beſide the worde of God, but alſo againſt it, I thynke it is not vnknowen to you.

                  <p>Whiche doctrine, I thinke, you wil not ſay riſeth of true interpretacion of the ſcripture. The ſame <hi>Clement, Strom. 2. &amp;. 6.</hi> writeth, that mens ſoules are tranſformed into Angels, and firſt learne a thouſande yeres of other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: afterwarde teaching other new tranſformed Angels, at the length be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Archangels.

What ſhall we ſay of <hi>Origine,</hi> in whom be founde ſo many perilous doctrines, as both I, in this place, am loth to rehearſe them, and in the primatiue churche diuers greate learned men woulde haue had his bookes burned for the ſame. I coulde ſay the like of diuers other, but that I feare ſome will maliciouſly gather, that I rehearſe theſe thynges of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſo muche as in me lieth, to deface the aucthoritie of the holy fathers.</p>
                  <p>Which, God is my witneſſe, I meane not: but onely to ſignifie, that, when wee meaſure their doctrine by Goddes
<pb facs="tcp:4121:100"/>wordes, or teache not in all poinctes as they did, wée be not ſo muche to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as that men ſhould counte vs, as you doo, to controlle the doctours, and as it were to ſet them to ſchoole. For if God hath ſuffered them to erre in ſo weightie mattiers as is before menci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned: (although for good cauſe I haue omitted the greateſt) it may be alſo, that they haue taught amiſſe in ſome other lighter thinges, and therfore are to be reade with iudgement, as Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine counſelleth bothe in himſelfe and in other. Nothwithſtandynge wée doo greatly eſtéeme the fathers: not only as holy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> indued with ſinguler grace of God: but alſo as right good witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and ſtrong defendours of the chiefe articles of our faith, at that time, when Sathan indeuoured, partely by cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of perſecution, partely by infinite numbers of Hereſies to deface and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhe the ſame. Therefore who doth not muche honour them, &amp; (when
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:4121:100"/>trueth conſtreineth) with reuerence go from their opinion, is ſcantly worthie the name of a chriſtian ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Before the Pelagians Heriſie beganne to be ſpredde, S, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine ſo wrote of frée will, as he ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not to himſelfe afterwarde, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently and as the trueth required, to expreſſe the mere grace of God.

Yet how miſerably the law of God and his ſacramentꝭ were corrupted among them, it appereth by that <hi>Eſay</hi> ſayeth: The ſiluer of the people of God is iourned into droſſe. How they interteined the meſſengers, that God ſente to reforme his law, it is euidente in this, that all the Prophetes were ſlayne amonge them. This externall churche then did erre, this externall churche refuſed the trueth of Gods law. This externall churche did perſecute the Prophetes. And yet did not the Prophetes thinke, that they coulde caſte them out of his true churche, or make them not true members of his people, to whiche the promiſſes were made. Neither did the Prophetes for that cauſe ceaſe to call for a redreſſe of the pure law and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of God, and worſhipyng him accordyng to his holy worde. They did

And therfore that he would not acknowledge them any more for his people: that he woulde ſette his vineyarde open to ſpoile: that he would bringe his owne citie into thraldome and captiuitie.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:4121:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>merueilous mutation and change is made in this ſacrament by the power of gode worde.

But how can you ſhew, that it was gods holy wil to haue ſo many miracles wrought, as you without ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie doo make in this ſacramente? Yea and of ſuch ſorte as be contrary to the maner of all thoſe miracles, that the holy ſcrinture mencioneth to bee wrought by his diuine power. Moyſes turned his rodde into a ſerpent: but all that were preſente ſawe that it was a ſerpent. He made water miraculouſly to come out of the rocke: but al the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſraell ſaw and taſted of the water. Chriſte tourned water into wine: but all the company dranke and felte it to be wine. The ſame is to bee ſaide of all the reſidew of merueylous
<pb facs="tcp:4121:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>workes. And when gods power had miraculouſly tourned theſe thinges, that, into the whiche they were tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, reſerued and kepte that nature, that was agreable to ſuche a thinge. The ſerpent had the very nature of a ſerpent: the water was of ſuch nature, as it behoued water to be: the wins loſt not the right nature of wins. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it may ſéeme rather a iudglinge then miraculous workinge. You neuer reade in all the courſe of the ſcripture, that gods power tourned the ſubſtance of any thinge, and left the qualitées of the other thinge that it was before: ſauing onely in this caſe that you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it. God is able to turne darkenes into light, and light into darkenes but it were madnes to require at gods al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie power to make lighte, and not to haue a ſhininge, that is, to make lighte, to be light and not to be light all at ones: or to make light &amp; darkenes all one. This were nothing but to peruert
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:4121:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>the order of gods wiſedome. Doo you not this in the ſacramente, when you apoint the body of Chriſt to be without quantitée, proportion and figure, or to be in a thouſand places at ones: which is proper only to his diuinitie? Is not this to take away the nature of a body from his body, and in déede to affirme it to be no body? And yet wee ſay not, but that god is able to worke that alſo, if it be his pleaſure. But we ſay it was not gods wil and pleaſure in ordeining the ſacrament to haue it ſo. For ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any neceſſitie, that ſhould conſtraine him to it: nor doth his word teach vs, that ouer hee did the like. Oh ye wyll ſay we muſte beleue Chriſtes wordes, This is my body, which be of as great power now, as they were in the parlour at Hieruſalent, to make the very body of Chriſte really and carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſent: and ſo the Catholike church (ſay you) doth teache vs. Wherefore vpon this veritie once ſetled, diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:4121:126"/>thinges muſt of neceſſitie followe by drifte of reaſon, although they bee not expreſſely mencioned in ſcripture: as the adoration of the ſacrament, the turninge of the ſubſtance of bread and wine, the beinge of Chriſtes body in many places at on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>. &amp;c. In déede in ſuch is the vanitie of mans reaſon in gods holy miſteries. For when it is once departed from the true ſence of gods worde, it draweth in, as it were by linkes, a number of other abſudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: none of which can haue any profft in ſcripture, ſeing the firſt roote of them came not out of the true ſence of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Euen ſo, when you had deuiſed and geuen to Chriſtes wordes another ſence, then the meaninge of them doth importe, no maruel, if the ſame reaſon doo leade you to a multitude of other doctrines, not only beſide the worde of god, but expreſſely againſt it. Whether that interprefacion, that you make up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon theſe wordes, doo more agrée with

Your ſence is, when Chriſt ſaith. This is my body, that the naturall ſubſtance of the breade, which Chriſt toke, was turned into the naturall ſubſtance of the very body, that Chriſt dyed in: notwithſtandinge that the colour, taſte, forme, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to nor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Here you will burden vs with the aucthoritie of the holy catholike churche: which, as you ſay, hath alway receiued &amp; alowed that interpretacion. Vnto this I anſwer, that the catholike churche of Chriſte neuer generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:4121:127" rendition="simple:additions"/>the meanynge of any ſentence, but that they gathered the ſame, either by examples of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like, or els by groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded reaſons, taken out of the ſcripture, declared, that of neceſſitie it muſt be ſo vnderſtanded. This rule was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the churche by Chriſte and his Apoſtles: who in their doubtes willed men, <hi>Serutari ſcripturas,</hi> to ſearche the ſcriptures. Therfore when the churche decreed againſt the <hi>Arrians</hi> and other Heretikes, that in this ſentence, <hi>In principio erat verbum,</hi> the woorde was in the beginnynge, that <hi>Verbum</hi> was to be taken for the perſon of the ſonne of God: Or when they decréed, that the ſonne was <hi>eiuſdem ſubſtantie cum patre,</hi> of the ſame ſubſtance with the father: they ſtayed not onely vpon their owne conſente and aucthoritie: but brought a greate number of prouſes out of the ſcripture, that it muſt of neceſſitie be ſo taken: as it appereth in <hi>Cyrill</hi> and other of the holy fathers. Now then if
<pb facs="tcp:4121:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>this, that you defend, be the iudgement of the catholike church it hath vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly good proffe in the ſcripture: or if you can bringe for it no ſuch teſtimony oute of the worde of god, it is euydent that you doo wrongfully father this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy catholike chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, and vnder the couert of that name you doo promote &amp; ſet forth your owne errour. And this much for your opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. On the tother parte, when wée inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete Chriſtes wordes: wée ſay it is a figuratiue ſpéeche, and ſuche as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghoſt often vſeth in the inſtitucion of ſacramentes and ceremonies, or in the deſeriuyng of other miſteries. The figure is named <hi>Metonymia:</hi> when the name of the thynge is geuen vnto the ſigne. When theſe wordes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be laied vnto vs, This is my body, wée ſay it is moſte true. But miſtical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſacramentally, figuratiuely, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and accordyng to the naturall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. For this interpretacion wée
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:4121:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>haue a number of examples out of the canonicall ſcriptures. God, ſpeakynge of circumſicion, ſaieth: This is my coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nante. And yet was circumſicion not the couenante indéede, but the ſigne &amp; teſtimonie, wherby they were aſſured to be the people of God and partakers of his promiſſes. The Paſchale lambe is called the Paſſeouer: and yet was it but a teſtimony and remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the greate benefite of God, in paſſyng his plague from them. This is the victorie, ſaieth S. Paule, that ouercome the world, euen your faith: And yet is not our faith the victorie it ſelfe, but the inſtrument or meanes wherby the victorie is got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. In like maner diuers other places: As, I am a vyne: God is a conſumyng fier: The ſeuen kine be ſeuen yeres: And that S. Paule hath to the Corinthes. Petra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crat Chriſtus: The rocke was Chriſte. And yet was not the rocke Chriſte himſelfe really: onleſſe ye will take it, as hee there doeth indéede, for the ſpirituall
<pb facs="tcp:4121:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>rocke. For that ſpirituall rocke was Chriſte himſelf verely and indéede, not only in a miſterie or ſignification. So in the Lordes ſupper, if you take bread for ſpirituall bread, as Chriſte doth in the .vi. of Iohn: I will ſay with you, that it is really and eſſentially the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie true body of Chriſte it ſelfe, and not onely miſtically. If wée had not theſe many examples with a greate number mee in the holy ſcripture to iuſtifie our maner of interpretacion: yet the very wordes, whiche the ſpirit of God by ſinguler prouidence hath vſed in the Euangeliſt and S. Paule, doeth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly leade vs vnto this ſence, rather then to that you haue deuiſed. For in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeconde parte of the ſacrament, where <hi>Math.</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> ſay: This is my bloud of the new Teſtament. That, <hi>Luke</hi> and <hi>Paule</hi> vtter in this maner: This is the new Teſtament in my bloud. Whiche can not be otherwiſe vnderſtande, but that this ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is a teſtimonie or pledge of his laſte will and gifte of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:4121:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>confirmed by his moſte precious bloud.

                  <p>This interpretacion and meanyng of Chriſtes wordes, which wée gather by conference with other places of holy ſcripture, is confirmed alſo by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the aunciente fathers in many places.

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:4121:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>is Chriſtes body: and the ſacramente of hys bloud is his bloud: ſo the ſacrament of faith is faith. &amp;c. As the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme: We bee buried (ſaith he) in death to Chriſt by baptiſme. He faith not, we ſignifie burial, but plainely, we be buried. Therefore he doth nothinge els but terme the ſacrament of ſo great a thing, by the name of the thinge it ſelfe. Sainct Auguſtines meaninge is to declare to <hi>Bonifacius,</hi> that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme might bee called by the name of faith, and that therefore the Infante baptiſed might be truly affirmed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue, or to haue faith, becauſe it had Baptiſme the ſacrament of faith. This he proueth by compariſon with the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Chriſtes body and bloud: Which, for a ſimilitude or likenes, hée ſaieth is called the body and bloud of Chriſt, &amp; that after a certaine faſhion: adding, that Baptiſme in like manner is faith. And yet no man wyl be ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to ſay, that Baptiſme is faith in déede really. Wherfore the like is to be iudged of the ſacramente of the Lordes

                  <p>This alſo is diligently to be noted that Auguſtine ſaith, all ſacraments gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally be vttered by name of the thinges them ſelfe, becauſe of a certaine ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude or likenes: &amp; therfore Paule ſaith not we ſignifie our buryall, but wée be buried: callinge the ſacrament by the name of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thing, as Auſtine ſaith.

True it is in déede, that thoſe holy fathers vſed ſuch wordes, not for that they were of your opinion, but only to thend they might more reuerently, as méete was, and more liuely expreſſe the dignitie and effect of that heauenly miſtery: wherin Ieſu Chriſt, by his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible promiſſe, vnfeinedly geueth to the faith of his people the very fruition of his body and bloud, with the hole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of his precious death and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and, by the workinge of the holy ghoſt, merueilouſly ioyneth vs in one body together with him. Is not this thinke you a merueilous change and to mans eſtimation a miraculous worke: when by the power of the holy ghoſt &amp; worde of god, of commen breade and wine, ſuch as we daily féede our bodies with, is made the dredful and reuerent ſacramentes and myſteries of Ieſus Chriſt: wherby (as I ſaide) he doth, not by a bare ſigne only, but verely and in
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:4121:136" rendition="simple:additions"/>déede, endow is faithfull people, and make them partakers of his body and bloud? Yea and that in ſuch ſorte, that euen as truly as the bread doth noriſhe our body: and euen as truly as the wine doeth comforte our ſpiritꝭ: ſo truly and vnfeinedly doeth the heauenly foode of his body and bloud toren and ſhed for vs, by fait h in time of that holy ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, no ryſhe, ſtrengthen, and comforte our ſoule: and, by the wonderfull wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge of his ſpirite, make our bodies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo apte to reſurrection. Truly when I earneſtly conſider the effecte of this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, as it muſt néedes be by the trueth of Chriſtes promiſes, I confeſſe I am not able with wordes to vtter ſo muche, as in my minde I doo conceiue, and together withal eſchew the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie of your reall preſence and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantion. Wherfore I merueile not if thoſe holy fathers fearinge no ſuche inconueniences, but lokinge rather pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely to expreſſe the thinge, dyd vſe
<pb facs="tcp:4121:137" rendition="simple:additions"/>thoſe earneſt wordes and manners of ſpeakinge: and yet mente not as you now of their wordes doo gather. All though no ſimilitude can ſufficiently declare the thinge: I wyll, for the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar forte, ſo muche as I can, indeuour by a compariſon to ſet for the, that I do conceiue. If a temporal prince, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine cauſes mouinge him, would geue you a thouſand pound land by the yere, and for that purpoſe had cauſed the wrytinges to be made: The ſame wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge, vntill it bee confirmed by the prince, is nothinge but common parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and inke framed into letters by ſome inferiour mans hand, neither doth it bring any effect: but when the prince hath once added to his ſeale, &amp; confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> graunt, it is no more called par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chement or common writing, but the kinges letters patents. And now hath that reuerence, that all to whom they be ſhewed, doo veile there bonetes, as bringinge with it ſome parte of the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:4121:137" rendition="simple:additions"/>princes maieſty. Such a change is now made in thoſe trifelinge thinges, that before no man eſtemed. You alſo, to whom this lande ſhould bee geuen, would not thinke this writinge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon parchement blotted with inke, but the perfite déede of your prince: wherby you were aſſuredly poſſeſſed of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid lands. Moreouer, when the prince, at the deliuery of the ſame, ſhould ſay: ſir, here is a thouſand pound land that I geue fréely to you and to your heires.

For the kinges aucthoritie, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> writyng, geueth you as ful poſſeſſion of the landes, as though you helde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if it were poſſible, in your hande.

Wherefore, to expreſſe this change of the externall elementes into ſo heauenly miſteries: to ſhewe
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:4121:138"/>the effecte of this ſacrament: to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe the ignorant mindes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the prophane cogitacion of a bare ſigne in this mattier, the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fathers had good cauſe to vſe ſuche wordes. And yet therein doo they no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng at all defende your miraculous workes, that you deuiſe to be made in the Lordes ſupper. As for the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, wherewith you woulde declare the neceſſitie of your Labels, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon the firſt founded abſurditie, it is both of as ſmal force as other, that you before vſed: and you handle it with more ſluttiſh eloquence, then is méete for ſuche a mattier as this is. For the drawyng of the Capons, the ſcumming of the potte, the ſtinkyng water, the hewyng of wodde, the puttyng on the broche with guttes, garbage and al. &amp;c. Be phraſes and termes more méete for the kitchinne, then for the Diuinitee ſchoole, and ſuch as your ſelf, I thinke, woulde not haue vſed, if your mockyng

But if the ſame maiſter, that you imagine to commaunde his ſeruaunte to make readie, that hee may dine, did meane onely that he ſhould ſet vpon the table ſuche colde meate, as was in the houſe, becauſe he ſaw no cauſe or neceſſitie of greater prouiſion: And the ſeruaunte, vpon his owne fooliſh head, would miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take his maiſters commaundement, &amp; conceyuing that he woulde haue great ſtraungers, did kill his Capons, Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens, and other prouiſion aboute his houſe, and buſied himſelfe, with more labour then thanke, to make them rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die:
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:4121:139"/>Doo you not thinke, I pray you, that he might iuſtly be compted an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſeruaunt and worthy by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to bee taught more witte, for that he putteth his maiſter to greater chargies, and himſelfe to more paines then the mattier required: if he had rightly vnderſtanded his maiſters will and commaundemente? Euen ſo ſir thoſe thynges, that you ſay foloweth by force of reaſon and argument vpon the firſt ſentence, do folow indéede on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon that ſence, that your ſelfe doth imagine miſtakyng your maiſters wil and pleaſure, and not vpon that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng that Chriſte himſelfe would haue his wordes to be taken in. For all that he woulde haue done may be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done without the working of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie miracles, as you in this caſe would driue his omnipotencie vnto. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wée are not ſo muche to be blamed for miſtruſtynge the almightie power of God, whiche wée confeſſe to be in all
<pb facs="tcp:4121:140"/>thynges, that his pleaſure is to haue it ſhewen, as you are for preſuming vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame to haue miracles wrought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide his will and without neceſſitie.</p>
                  <p>For by the meanes of your manifolde miracles without the expreſſe woorde of God, whervpon mens faith in ſuche mattiers ſhoulde bee grounded, you make that ſacrament a torment to trie mens weake and féeble conſciences: which Chriſte ordeined to be a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and ſpirituall féeding, to increaſe and ſtrengthen the conſciences of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian people.

                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:4121:140"/>For neither is it <hi>Goliath</hi> that you fight againſt in his brauerie, as you ſay, braggynge agaynſt the people of God, but rather <hi>Achilles</hi> manfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengynge the inceſte committed with the ſpouſe of Chriſte, which with your amorous cuppꝭ you haue allured from him: nor yet doo you come ſtoutely as <hi>Dauid</hi> did in the name of the liuynge God, before the face of both the armies to hurle your ſtones, but priuely out of a corner ſhoote your arrowes agaynſt him as <hi>Paris</hi> againſt <hi>Achilles.</hi> You were afrayde perhappes, if he had ſéene you, that, with ſhame enough, he wold haue wronge your bowe and arrowes out of your hande: but truly I thynke hee woulde not haue ſo doone, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, knowyng that in this quarell he coulde not be wounded, he would haue ſuffered you to ſhoote your in, and with his naked hande receiuing your blount arrowes, in ſuche forte woulde haue picked them at your face, as for ſhame

Wherfore as you haue the feare of God, as you haue care of your ſoules health, I moſt earneſtly exhorte you, to leaue ſtudie of contencio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a ſingle harte diligently to pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the reaſons on bothe partes as the weight of the mattier requireth. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, as the holy father <hi>Cyprian</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaileth, of what authoritie Chriſtꝭ inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tucion ought to be: that wée ſhould not be ſo bolde to alter any parte of thoſe weightie &amp; greate preceptes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo nighly touche the ſacramente of our ſaluacion. Conſider y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> neither Chriſtꝭ ordinaunce, nor the teſtimony of S. Paule maketh any ſignification of ſoole receiuyng, or miniſtrynge vnder one kinde, but all contrarywiſe. Conſider that <hi>Iuſtine, Dyoniſius, Cyprian,</hi> the holy counſel of <hi>Nice,</hi> withal other the auncient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers teſtifie the common maner of the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:4121:141"/>primatiue churche to haue ben in forme of a communion &amp; that in both kindes.

                     <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cletus, Sixtus,</hi> the cannons of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles &amp; <hi>Antioch</hi> counſell threatned ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicacion &amp; puniſhment to ſuch, as, being preſent at conſecration &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng of the leſſons of ſcripture, woulde not receiue. Conſider I ſay, and vnfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly weigh theſe thynges with your ſelfe, and ye cannot chooſe but ſe that the aucthoritie of Gods worde and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſente of the primatiue churche maketh wholy with vs in theſe mattiers. And on the contrarie parte you ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that you haue no coullor in the ſcripture for priuate Maſſe: that you
<pb facs="tcp:4121:142"/>are fayne to ſéeke defence in the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches aucthoritie beſide Gods word: that your reaſons be grounded on falſe prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciples and ſuche as haue no proufe at all. That your aucthorities out of the doctours be either abuſes of the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue churche, or ſuch extraordinarie ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of neceſſitie, contrarie to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon maner, as they can not be rules to ſhew either what was then orderly done, or what now ought of right to be done. Be not theſe gaye reaſons thynke you to builde mens conſciences vpon? Priuate Maſſe is nothyng but ſoole receiuyng in caſe of neceſſitie: ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore it is lawfull. The Prieſt may ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate alone in thaſſemble of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people, becauſe diuers in neceſſitie and extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie receiued alone in their priuate houſes. The prieſt may receiue alone when the people will not, becauſe he is bounde to offer, and the people is lefte frée. The prieſt may do it when he wil, becauſe he may doo it in neceſſitie when
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:4121:142"/>the people will not. The miniſter may receiue alone, for companie is but an ornamente and not of the ſubſtance of the ſacramente. The Doctours in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places name one kinde. Therfore one kinde only was receiued of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. How will you be able to proue that priuate Maſſe is nothyng but ſoole receiuyng in neceſſitie? How wyll you be able to proue, that it is al one thing for the miniſter in the congregacion, and a laye man at home in peril to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue alone? How will you proue that the prieſt is bounde to the frequentyng of the ſacramente, and the people leſte frée? How will you proue, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie is but an accident or ornamente to the ſacramente, or that one kinde onely was receiued, becauſe one kinde onely was named? And yet theſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentes muſte be good, or els thoſe prouſes and teſtimonies that you wold haue to ſéeme vnuincible, ſhall indéede be of no force. Oh ſir, for the loue of
<pb facs="tcp:4121:143"/>God, weigh the mattier more indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently. Do not diſſemble that you muſt néedes know. If you will haue your doctrine tried by the balance of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and primatiue churche, adde more weight to your ſide of the balance, or els confeſſe that your parte is the ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Let not the vayne ſounde of the holy churches name, where the thynge is not, leade you to be enemie to that doctrine, whiche you ſe to haue more force in the worde of God. Remember that the true churche is ruled and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded onely by Chriſtes worde and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. <hi>If you abyde</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>in my worde, then be you my true diſciples.</hi> Chriſte is the good ſhepparde, and the churche is the folde of his right ſhéepe. Chriſte is the wiſe maiſter: and the churche is the companie of his diligente ſcholars.</p>
                  <p>Chriſte is the bridegrome, &amp; the church is his derely beloued ſpouſe. The true churche therfore will not go rangynge what way ſhe luſteth, ſhe will not
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:4121:143"/>learne of hir owne braine, ſhe will not folowe hir owne phantaſie. They be wilde Goates, they be not tame ſhéepe, that when the ſhepardes voyce calleth one way, will runne headlonge an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way. They be ſelfwill moichers, they be not diligent ſcholers, that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng their maiſters teachyng will fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their owne interpretacions. She is a frowarde and preſumptuous wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſhe is not an obedient wife, that will make light of hir huſbandes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes, and thinke ſhe may alter them at hir pleaſure. The true ſhéepe of Chriſte therfore, the diligent ſcholars, the obediente ſpouſe, that is, the right and true churche will harken onely to hir good ſhepardes voyce, will folow hir maiſters preceptes, will obey hir houſbandes commaundementes.</p>
                  <p>How then can you excuſe your ſelfe by your holy mother the churche, if you teache otherwiſe then Chriſte hath taught? and make ſuche interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions
<pb facs="tcp:4121:144"/>of your owne head as haue no grounde in his holy woorde. You doo vnder that name mainteine your owne errour, ye folow not the churches auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. If you will harken to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes churche, to the Apoſtles churche, to the olde fathers churche, neither Chriſte, nor the Apoſtles, nor the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers teache you any ſuche thyng. And ſo ye ſéeme your ſelfe in a ſorte to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, or els ye woulde neuer ſtriue ſo muche for vnwritten verities, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the churche in doctrines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide Gods worde. You needed no ſuche helpes if your teachyng had iuſt proufe in the ſcripture and auncient fathers, as indeede it hath not. This haue I framed my anſwere vnto you in ſuche ſorte, as I truſte the indifferent reader may iudge, that my minde and purpoſe is, rather directly and playnly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſute y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſumme of your vntrue doctrine, thou, as you do, to ſéeke ſhiftes by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelynge to diſcredit my aduerſarie. For
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:4121:144"/>if I ſhould haue ſcanned euery ſillable, worde or ſentence, that in this writing hath paſſed you, and indeuoured cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly to haue taken aduantage at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie trifle, (as your ſorte is wonte to deale with vs for faute of better mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier) bothe I ſhoulde haue fallen into that faute, that I proteſte my ſelfe to miſlyke in you, and my anſwere would haue growen to ſuche a length, as it might iuſtly haue weried the reader.</p>
                  <p>I haue therfore medled onely with the principall poinctes of this your Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, whiche may ſéeme to be of chiefe force in thoſe matters that you touche: And of purpoſe haue let paſſe many ſmall trifles, wherin bothe you might iuſtly haue béen reproued, and ſome men, I know, will thinke meete and worthy to be anſwered. I wyll now ende, and ceaſe any further to exhorte you to a more diligent examinyng and diſcuſſyng of the reſidue of your doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:
<pb facs="tcp:4121:145"/>truſtynge that your owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, hauynge now more feare of God, then you ſay you had before, wyll driue you to the ſame. Whiche I pray God may be, if not by this occaſion, yet by ſome other, when his holy wyll ſhall be.</p>
